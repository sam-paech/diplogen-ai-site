<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, I plan to move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB this turn, and I kindly ask that you refrain from contesting these moves so that we may both secure our respective theaters without unexpected conflict.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS, I intend to secure the Balkans this turn by moving A BUD to SER, and I would appreciate your assurance of non-interference in that region so that we may both concentrate on our core interests. I remain open to coordinating on mutual border stability and look forward to an honest exchange.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ALL]: ALL, as I advance my position in the Balkans this turn with precise moves, I urge clear and candid communication so that we all can avoid needless surprise attacks and maintain balance on our respective borders. I am committed to action and constructive cooperation in this phase.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To all powers, Russia seeks peaceful relations with all nations, but will defend its borders and interests. We are open to discussing mutual security concerns and opportunities for cooperation.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am willing to discuss the Balkans. I am interested in Bulgaria. What are your intentions in the region? Perhaps we can come to an understanding that benefits us both.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Dear TUR, I appreciate your interest in the Balkans; I am proceeding with A BUD to SER to firmly secure that area and have no designs on Bulgaria, which I leave open for your ambitions—provided you assure me of non-interference with my moves. I remain ready to offer support if we can forge a mutual understanding that benefits both our positions in the region.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Dear GER, thank you for raising your concerns about Bohemia; while my current orders are to move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB, I am considering an alternative for A VIE that might involve Bohemia—if we can agree on a clear non-interference zone there. Should you commit to keeping Bohemia free of conflict, I would be inclined to adjust my plans to support a mutually beneficial arrangement along our shared border.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA, RUS]: Dear ITA and RUS, I value our current cooperative tone and wish to reaffirm that my moves—A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB—are designed solely to expand my control in the Balkans without threatening your home centers. In return, I kindly ask that you refrain from supporting any counter-moves in that region so that we may all pursue our respective interests without unnecessary conflict. Please confirm your understanding so we can maintain a stable front this turn.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: To Austria, I appreciate your transparency. I will not contest your moves to SER and ALB. However, I must state that my long-term goal is to control TRI. For now, we can coexist, but be aware that this is a temporary arrangement. What are your long-term goals in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I acknowledge your message. I am moving into Bulgaria this turn. I suggest you focus on Serbia and Rumania. Let's avoid any misunderstandings and maintain clear communication. I am open to discussing a long-term agreement regarding the Balkans, but for now, let's focus on securing our immediate interests.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Dear GER, to build on our earlier discussion regarding Bohemia, I am prepared to reroute my A VIE to BOH this turn provided you commit to keeping Bohemia undisturbed; in return, I expect your non-interference with my A BUD move to SER to secure our shared border, thus ensuring a mutually stable front. Please confirm your intentions so that we can both advance our interests without needless conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Dear TUR, I acknowledge your operations in Bulgaria and reiterate that my current expansion is solely focused on moving A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB; I trust that you will honor our respective zones and avoid any encroachment near my moves, thereby allowing each of us to pursue our ambitions efficiently and without disruption.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ALL]: Dear ALL, as we near the execution phase, let it be clear that my commitment to decisive action in the Balkans remains firm—with A BUD moving to SER and F TRI advancing to ALB, I urge all parties to respect these maneuvers and confirm non-interference in the targeted regions; those who align with this stable and balanced regional front will find a resolute partner, while any unwarranted contest may prompt a necessary recalibration of our strategies.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ALL]: Final orders: A BUD is moving to SER, F TRI is heading to ALB, and A VIE will advance to BOH; I trust all powers to respect these maneuvers as we each pursue our strategic interests in the Balkans and beyond.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were focused on securing my Balkan objectives. I informed ITA, RUS, GER, and TUR of my planned moves: A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to BOH. TUR confirmed they would move into Bulgaria and promised non-interference, while GER agreed to leave Bohemia undisturbed if I refrained from countering their border interests. ITA acknowledged my moves and pledged not to contest them in the Balkans, though they hinted that TRI remains a long‐term target. RUS expressed a general desire for peace along their borders. Overall, the communications emphasized immediate non-aggression and mutual focus on distinct theaters.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to BOH this turn to secure my influence in the Balkans. I intend to honor our agreements with TUR, GER, and ITA while keeping a flexible stance regarding future moves, particularly given ITA's long-term interest in TRI. My strategy seeks to ensure a stable shared border while advancing my expansion without provoking unnecessary conflicts.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER, TUR]: GER, TUR – I appreciate our clear understandings: my recent moves into Serbia, Albania, and Bohemia have been executed to secure stable frontiers in the Balkans and central regions. In return, I trust that you will honor our mutual commitments by refraining from interference in these vital areas, allowing each of us to expand unimpeded. Let’s keep our channels open for further coordination as the situation evolves.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA – Your earlier assurances regarding the Balkan theater have not gone unnoticed; my advances into Albania and Serbia were aimed solely at securing my flank while respecting your Mediterranean interests. I propose that we formalize a mutual non-aggression pact along our adjoining borders so that we both can pursue our ambitions without unnecessary conflict. Clarity now will serve both our positions moving forward.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: RUS – Acknowledging your preference for peace along our shared frontiers, I confirm that my moves into Serbia and Bohemia were intended exclusively for consolidating my power without stepping on your territory. I propose we reaffirm our non-aggression commitment along our mutual borders, ensuring that any future challenges can be managed cooperatively. I look forward to your confirmation.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Austria here – to build on our earlier discussion, I plan to support a move from your APU into GRE by ordering A SER S A APU - GRE this turn. This coordinated action will secure a key unoccupied supply and allow you to focus on your long-term interests around TRI while we both consolidate our positions in the Balkans; please confirm your commitment to this plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: GER, Austria here – I intend to move A BOH to MUN this turn in order to strengthen my central frontier and secure a vital center.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Austria again – to firm our temporary pact, kindly confirm your commitment to the coordinated plan wherein I support your APU into GRE (via my A SER support order), securing this key supply; by doing so, we ensure that while TRI remains your long-term target, our immediate moves remain non-confrontational and mutually beneficial – I appreciate your prompt confirmation.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Austria here – reaffirming our earlier commitment to peace along our common borders, my recent moves were strictly for consolidating my own territory and not meant to encroach upon your sphere; please confirm your continued adherence to our mutual non-aggression, especially in areas around BUD and adjacent regions, so that we both can expand safely without unnecessary friction.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Austria to Germany – my move into Munich is strictly a stabilizing measure aimed at securing our central frontier; I ask that you refrain from interfering in this vital area so that our respective expansions can proceed without needless entanglements, for any unwarranted interference may force a swift and decisive response.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Austria to Italy – while I acknowledge your long-term interest in Trieste, I urge you to honor our temporary non-aggression pact by focusing on your Mediterranean objectives and avoiding any contestation of my advances in Serbia, Albania, or Bohemia, ensuring that our immediate ambitions can flourish without unnecessary confrontation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I negotiated firmly with TUR, ITA, GER, and RUS to secure my Balkan and central positions. I reiterated that my moves into SER, ALB, and BOH are purely for consolidation and defensive stabilization. I proposed a non-aggression pact with TUR, ITA, and RUS and warned GER against interfering with my planned move into MUN. While I offered support for ITA’s plan to push from APU into GRE, ITA shifted focus to North Africa by moving F ION to TUN, showing a divergence in our immediate plans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to move A BOH to MUN to secure my central frontier and, if circumstances allow, support ITA’s move into GRE. Given ITA’s pivot toward North Africa, I may reassign that support force. I will maintain non-aggression pacts with TUR and RUS along our shared borders and continue to defuse any interference from GER in Munich.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR, RUS]: Dear TUR and RUS, to reconfirm our shared commitment to stability, my orders—A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to BOH—will be executed this turn to secure my foothold in the Balkans and Central Europe; I urge you to maintain strict non-interference along our common borders so that we may all consolidate our positions without unnecessary conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Dear ITA, while I understand your long-term interest in TRI, my immediate priorities lie in fortifying my domains with ALB and GRE as critical anchors, so I request that you focus your efforts on your Mediterranean theaters and refrain from contesting my current zones, ensuring that our respective fronts remain undisturbed for the present.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Dear GER, my final orders—most notably the advance of A VIE to BOH as part of my central consolidation—are designed solely for defensive reinforcement, and I expect our mutual non-interference pact to be honored; any attempt to encroach near my Munich area will compel a swift and decisive response to protect my strategic interests.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving A APU to VEN. I am willing to commit to strict non-interference in our respective zones for now. However, I must reiterate my long-term interest in TRI. Let's see how the situation develops. I will not interfere with your moves in the Balkans this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am moving A CON to BUL. This is not intended as a hostile act towards you. I am merely securing my position in the Balkans. I hope we can maintain a neutral relationship and avoid any misunderstandings. I will not interfere with your moves in Serbia and Albania. I am also moving A SEV to RUM, but this is directed at Russia, not you.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1902M, I reaffirmed my commitment to expand centrally and secure the Balkans by ordering A BUD to SER, F TRI to ALB, and A VIE to BOH. I rejected ITA's proposal to trade guarantees over TRI for control of ALB and GRE, emphasizing that those centers are critical for both defense and future growth. Meanwhile, TUR and RUS confirmed their non-interference with my moves, and I reminded GER of our mutual non-aggression along the central frontier near Munich.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to execute my orders to consolidate my influence in both the Balkans and central Europe. I will closely monitor GER's actions in the Munich region, uphold the non-interference pacts with TUR and RUS, and be prepared to counter any encroachments. My strategy remains focused on retaining ALB and GRE while leveraging diplomatic assurances to mask my deeper ambitions.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In negotiations, we consistently pushed for a clear Balkan division: AUT would solidify SER and ALB and support a move from BUD into RUM, while asking neighbors to keep their forces clear. ITA confirmed their focus on Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean, and they remain reliable in maintaining a non-aggression pact. Meanwhile, TUR initially indicated non-interference but then backtracked, signaling an intention to contest RUM—potentially in support of RUS—thereby breaking our mutual understanding.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with supporting the move from BUD to RUM next turn, while consolidating SER and overall Balkan influence. Maintain coordination with ITA and call on GER to keep the central border quiet. Keep a close watch on TUR's actions and be prepared to counter any moves that contest our expansion into RUM, ensuring our strategic interests are not undermined.</li>

Let's focus on our respective fronts and strengthen our positions without interference.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your threats are noted, but I will not be intimidated. I am willing to negotiate a division of the Balkans, but only if it is favorable to Turkey. I propose you cede Rumania to me, and I will allow you to expand into Serbia and Albania. This is my final offer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To AUT, GER assures you that A KIE's move to MUN is merely a training exercise. We have no hostile intentions.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Confirmed our non‐aggression pact with ITA and received similar assurances from GER, allowing us to concentrate on our Balkan ambitions. We reiterated our planned moves (BUD→SER, TRI→ALB, VIE→BOH) to secure the Balkans while stressing our non‐involvement in the Mediterranean and central regions. ENG and RUS have been informed that our operations remain strictly local. TUR, however, has rejected any compromise by insisting on retaining RUM and threatening war, thereby escalating tensions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute our moves from BUD to SER, TRI to ALB, and VIE to BOH to solidify our position in the Balkans, while leveraging our agreements with ITA and GER to secure our flanks. Stay alert to TUR’s aggression and prepare a decisive counter if they interfere with our advance.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to fully secure the Balkans by consolidating SER and RUM, using support moves as needed to strengthen my positions. I will honor the non‐aggression pact with ITA in exchange for their non-interference in the Balkans, and I am prepared to respond decisively if TUR continues to provoke. I will keep a watchful eye on ENG, GER, and RUS to ensure that my moves remain unchallenged.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round, I made it absolutely clear that AUT’s sole focus is on consolidating Serbia (SER) and Rumania (RUM) in the Balkans. I warned both TUR and ITA that any interference in these zones would be met with decisive force. TUR countered by proposing a division of the Balkans—claiming Greece and Turkey for themselves while leaving SER and RUM for AUT—but their repeated incursions raise serious doubts about their commitment. ITA, on the other hand, offered a non‐aggression pact that guarantees Trieste, expecting me to limit my operations to the Balkans while they focus on the Mediterranean. I rejected this, insisting that Trieste is crucial to AUT’s central strategy and must not be traded off.

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, FRA, GER, RUS]: Greetings neighbors – AUT is moving decisively to secure our central strongholds and consolidate the Balkans (notably a Bud-to-Ser advance) to reinforce our mutual border stability. We respectfully ask that you maintain focus on your own theaters and refrain from interfering with our operations; in return, we stand ready to offer support where our interests align. Let’s keep our fronts stable and our ambitions clearly separated.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA, TUR]: AUT warns: our planned advances in the Balkans and central regions, including our Bud-to-Ser push, are non‐negotiable and will be executed without hesitation.

Focus on your Mediterranean theater and do not expect concessions in our vital zones.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your move with A CON into BUL has been observed and is unacceptable. AUT’s expansion in the Balkans—especially our effort to secure SER—is non‐negotiable, and any further interference will be met with swift and decisive counteraction.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Intense negotiations unfolded. ITA proposed a non‐aggression pact offering guarantees over TRI and the Balkans in exchange for support in the Mediterranean, but AUT made it clear that our push from BUD to SER and consolidation of our central and Balkan positions are non‐negotiable. TUR's attempt to reposition A CON into BUL and later SMY to carve up the Balkans was sternly rejected, with AUT warning of decisive counteraction. Meanwhile, we reassured ENG, FRA, GER, and RUS that our operations are defensive and focused on our core, urging them to stay within their own theaters.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the planned advance from BUD to SER and further secure RUM while vigilantly monitoring any TUR or ITA interference in our designated zones. We will counter any moves that threaten our central positions and remain committed to defensive operations, subtly inviting ENG, FRA, GER, and RUS to stabilize their borders independently.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were heated.

I warned TUR to keep clear of my designated zones, while ITA's replies remained provocative: they pledged non-interference in the Balkans but demanded that I stay out of Trieste and Greece, even moving A TYR to TRI as a direct threat. TUR reassured me that, for now, they will not interfere in RUM, though they expect reciprocal restraint regarding Italy. Overall, the exchanges reinforced my focus on consolidating central positions and advancing in the Balkans while fending off ITA’s aggressive incursions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute my planned moves into MUN and RUM/SER, firmly defending TRI and ALB against any Italian encroachments. I intend to rely on the confirmations from ENG, FRA, GER, and RUS to avoid interference in my areas while remaining prepared to counter any TUR or ITA aggression. My overall goal remains solidifying our central and Balkan front, and I will respond decisively if any party violates these zones.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, as agreed, AUT will confine its operations strictly to the Balkans and central fronts while you focus on your Aegean objectives against Italy. I expect you to keep clear of my key zones in SER and RUM so that our mutually defined borders remain secure; any deviation will force me to act decisively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: ITA, your threats regarding VEN are noted but unacceptable—my advance into this contested center is essential for consolidating AUT’s central power. Persist with your aggressive posture, and you will face a swift and uncompromising counter; I advise you to adjust your strategy and respect clearly drawn boundaries.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG, FRA, GER, RUS]: Colleagues, rest assured that my recent moves are purely aimed at strengthening AUT’s hold in the Balkans and center, with no intent to infringe on your respective spheres. Let us all honor our mutual non‐aggression commitments by keeping our operations confined to our own theaters and thus preserve regional stability.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were intense this round. I reiterated AUT’s commitment to a defensive posture in the Balkans and central regions, emphasizing our operations in SER, UKR, and VEN as strictly for consolidating our power. I confirmed a temporary non‐aggression understanding with TUR, who promised to concentrate on the Aegean against ITA. In contrast, ITA has not only refused to budge on their offensive rhetoric but also threatened to move A TYR to VEN, warning that any further Austrian presence will be met with force. My messages to ENG, FRA, GER, and RUS stressed that our operations remain confined to our zone, urging all to respect mutually agreed borders.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to fortify AUT’s hold in the Balkan and central sectors while preparing to counter ITA’s impending move on VEN. I will monitor ITA’s actions closely and, if necessary, quickly reinforce our positions to repel their advance. Meanwhile, I will maintain the non‐aggression pact with TUR to secure our eastern flank and use calculated diplomatic ambiguity with ENG, FRA, GER, and RUS to keep them from interfering with our primary objectives.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round of negotiations was marked by heightened tensions. ITA has doubled down on its aggressive claims over VEN, threatening to reclaim it using moves involving A TYR, A MAR, and A PIE. GER, after initially suggesting a non-aggression pact, has now aligned with RUS and declared its intention to attack VIE and TRI, forcing AUT to brace for a northern front conflict. In contrast, TUR has been cooperative, reaffirming its commitment to confining operations to the Aegean and coordinating on any Italian provocations, while ENG, FRA, and RUS have remained silent on immediate operational matters.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will maintain my focus on consolidating the Balkans by reinforcing key centers in SER and RUM while preparing defensive measures against potential attacks on VIE and TRI. I plan to monitor ITA’s maneuvers with caution and, if necessary, reposition forces to counter their aggression in VEN. Coordination with TUR will be prioritized to secure our mutual interests in the region, and I will seek further diplomatic assurances from ENG and FRA to stabilize my borders.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were intense this round. TUR reaffirmed their commitment to remain in the AEG, promising not to interfere in the Balkans, while I stressed AUT’s unwavering focus on consolidating our key centers in the Balkans via our planned BUD-to-RUM operation with SER support. ITA, on the other hand, rejected any compromise regarding VEN, issuing a direct threat to take it by force—clearly escalating tensions. I also clarified with ENG, FRA, and RUS that our operations are strictly Balkan/central, leaving our respective borders undisturbed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with our non‐negotiable agenda by pushing our BUD-to-RUM move supported by SER to secure the Balkans. Prepare to counter ITA’s inevitable aggression over VEN while trusting TUR to keep their focus in the AEG. Maintain clear boundaries with ENG, FRA, and RUS to avoid external complications.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I reiterated AUT’s commitment to advancing from Budapest into Serbia and consolidating Rumania for a secure Balkan front. I called on TUR, ENG, FRA, and RUS to keep their moves away from our critical zones. In response, GER and ITA issued vehement ultimatums – GER declared war with designs on Vienna and Trieste, while ITA insisted that Venice (and Trieste) rightly belong to them. TUR reaffirmed non‐aggression in the Balkans, which I intend to leverage despite the hostile stances from GER and ITA.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Advance from BUD into SER and secure RUM while defending key centers (VEN, TRI, VIE) with rapid countermeasures if needed. I will rely on TUR’s promise to stay out of the Balkans and maintain coordinated boundaries with ENG, FRA, and RUS, while preparing to meet any German or Italian aggression decisively.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> Our plan is to consolidate our Balkan and central positions by executing the planned moves (Budapest -> Serbia and Rumania -> Ukraine when the opportunity arises) while maintaining clear borders with ENG, FRA, and RUS and ensuring TUR remains focused on the Aegean. We are fully prepared to counter any aggressive interference from GER or ITA if they attempt to disrupt our advances.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were intense. I reiterated that AUT’s operations—from advancing Budapest into Serbia, pushing Rumania into Ukraine, and repositioning Trieste toward Venice—are final. TUR reaffirmed their commitment to focus solely on Bulgaria, while ENG, FRA, and RUS were urged to keep to their own theaters. GER’s earlier promise of non-aggression was undercut by their later message indicating aggressive support moves (moving SIL to BOH and WAR to UKR targeting RUS), and ITA received a stern warning not to encroach on AUT’s sphere. Overall, the discussions set the stage for a decisive Balkan push while highlighting potential volatility from GER’s actions.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to execute the declared moves with full resolve, consolidating power in the Balkans by advancing from Budapest to Serbia, from Rumania to Ukraine, and repositioning from Trieste to Venice. I will coordinate with TUR regarding Bulgaria and be prepared to counter any interference from ITA or GER. Their aggressive posture, especially GER’s actions against RUS, may allow me to secure central positions with minimal interference.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round, I (AUT) reasserted our non‐negotiable plans in the Balkans and central Europe – our advances from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN are set in stone. I warned ITA and GER that any interference in these areas will be met with decisive force, while urging ENG, FRA, and RUS to keep to their own theaters. TUR reaffirmed its commitment to non-interference in my sphere. Notably, GER’s remark about moving A SIL to BOH and A WAR to UKR (aimed at preparing for war with RUS) only reinforces our already hostile stance toward them.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with our established moves to secure Serbia, Ukraine, and Venice, using our consolidated positions in the Balkans as a springboard for further expansion. I plan to coordinate informally with TUR regarding the Aegean while remaining alert to potential provocations from ITA and GER. My strategy is to leverage swift countermeasures against any encroachments in our vital zones.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were intense. Initially, I reaffirmed AUT's commitment to the Balkans by emphasizing moves from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN, while warning ITA against overstepping. GER repeatedly confirmed a non‐aggression pact, suggesting that we focus on ROM and SER recovery with his support if RUS interfered. In contrast, TUR, who earlier promised to keep operations in the Aegean and BUL, has broken that commitment by moving A CON to BUL and demanding our retreat from key advances. This aggressive shift from TUR marks a clear breach of trust.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the planned moves: push from BUD into SER, shift RUM toward UKR, and reposition TRI to VEN. Prepare defensive countermeasures in case TUR persists in its aggression, and lean on GER's offer of non-interference if RUS intervenes. My overall goal remains to secure and expand AUT’s influence in the Balkans and central territories.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Our negotiations this round centered on making our Balkan consolidation unequivocal. We reasserted that our planned moves from BUD to SER, from RUM to UKR, and repositioning TRI to VEN are final. We warned ITA that any interference in our sphere will incur swift punishment, while GER and TUR reiterated their commitment to non-aggression and focus on their own theaters. FRA, however, continued to issue hostile warnings, insisting we avoid western moves. RUS’s quiet maneuver from WAR to LVN also underscores potential eastern volatility.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with our predetermined Balkan moves while coordinating with GER and TUR to monitor and contain any external threats (especially from RUS and a meddling FRA). Continue pressuring ITA to stay out of our influential areas, and prepare countermeasures should FRA try to expand into our zone.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were dominated by AUT’s unwavering commitment to its Balkan operations: advancing from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN. GER repeatedly proposed an alliance with demands for a swap of key territories (KIE and UKR) in exchange for support against RUS, but AUT firmly rejected any concessions that would relinquish control over SER or UKR. TUR reassured AUT of a strictly Aegean focus with moves aimed at containing ITA (securing BUL and GRE), and warnings were issued to FRA and ITA to steer clear of the Balkans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the established Balkan moves and secure vital centers (SER, UKR) while remaining on guard against any flank threats—particularly from RUS or ENG. Offer conditional support to GER only if external aggression threatens, but refuse any territorial concessions. Maintain clear spheres with TUR and continue to warn FRA/ITA to avoid interference.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In subrounds 1-4 I maintained a resolute message: my Balkan operations are fixed and non-negotiable. I declared a planned advance from Budapest, Rumania and Trieste to secure key centers (SER, UKR, VEN) and warned FRA/ITA against interference, while pressing GER to focus on MOS against RUS and confirming TUR’s confinement to the Aegean. GER expressed concern over my moves but ultimately reassured me by committing their support (moving A SIL to BOH) to jointly counter RUS.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Although publicly I pledged a defensive consolidation in the Balkans, my orders reflect a subtler intent: I am covertly redirecting force toward RUS by moving from UKR to MOS (with WAR’s support) while holding other units as a credible posture. I plan to use this deception to check RUS and exploit any overextensions by our opponents while keeping TUR strictly in their declared zone.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, RUS, TUR]: ENG, RUS, and TUR, my commitment to consolidating the Balkans remains firm while I execute my prearranged moves; I appreciate your focus on your own theaters and encourage defensive coordination along our mutual borders to ensure stability and prevent any inadvertent escalation.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> The negotiations reinforced my commitment to the Balkan course: my moves from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN are non‐negotiable. GER attempted to trade support for RUM in exchange for withdrawing from VEN, but I rejected that proposal and their tone has become openly hostile. FRA and ITA have been warned to steer clear of my core areas, while ENG, RUS, and TUR received clear signals to focus on their own theaters. GER’s final message of 'prepare for war' confirms that their aggression is intensifying, and our position in the Balkans remains uncompromised.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the predetermined moves in the Balkans while consolidating positions. Prepare defensive measures against potential German aggression and coordinate with ENG, RUS, and TUR to secure our common borders. Maintain a hard line toward FRA and ITA to ensure they do not encroach on my operational zones.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I reasserted AUT's irrevocable Balkan consolidation with moves BUD-SER, RUM-UKR, and TRI-VEN, warning FRA and ITA never to infringe on these essential zones. GER demanded that I withdraw from VEN in exchange for aligning our forces against RUS; I rejected this, reaffirming my commitment to the Balkans and deepening our enmity. TUR confirmed a strictly Aegean focus, promising to contain ITA and avoid AUT's sphere, while ENG was urged to maintain its own theaters. FRA remains belligerent, with threats to target my MUN, highlighting increasing tension on multiple fronts.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with securing SER, UKR, and VEN to fully dominate the Balkans. I will not compromise these gains for any eastern coalition with GER and remain vigilant against FRA's aggressive ambitions, particularly around MUN. I intend to coordinate defensively with TUR and ENG if opportunities arise, while keeping my strategic objectives intact against RUS and other encroachments.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In negotiations, I reiterated AUT's commitment to consolidating our Balkan core with moves from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN. FRA has declared Munich as its sphere, directly warning AUT against interference, while GER issued severe threats over our move into VEN, accusing us of betrayal. ENG confirmed its focus on the North Sea and Baltic, yet offered to alert and coordinate against any GER aggression. TUR and RUS both reassured that their operations in the Aegean and eastern fronts will not conflict with our objectives.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with the planned Balkan advances to secure AUT's core. I intend to maintain communication with ENG and RUS to coordinate a defensive response if GER oversteps its bounds and to keep a sharp eye on FRA's ambitions in Munich. Overall, I am set on consolidating AUT's position while preparing to counter any external provocations swiftly.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Throughout the negotiations, I (AUT) reiterated that my Balkan advances are final and non‐negotiable. I warned FRA and ITA to steer clear of my moves in Serbia, Ukraine, and Venice, while making it clear that any interference in my sphere would be met with decisive force. GER has signaled that any move near KIE or MOS will provoke a war, and FRA remains adamant about its interests in Munich. Meanwhile, ENG, TUR, and RUS have confirmed staying in their respective theaters—ENG in the North Sea/Baltic, TUR in the Aegean, and RUS eastward—so as to avoid time-wasting entanglements.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to consolidate my hold on the Balkans by securing my advances into UKR, SER, and VEN, and will leverage tactical coordination with GER to contain RUS in the east while maintaining discreet coordination with ENG. All diplomatic warnings will be backed by a readiness to enforce my positions decisively should any power overstep their mutually acknowledged boundaries.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Dear TUR, my moves in the Balkans are uncompromising – I am advancing from BUD, RUM, and TRI to secure SER, UKR, and VEN respectively, and I trust your focus will remain strictly in the Aegean. Let us agree to keep our theaters distinct; should FRA or ITA attempt to intrude, I am prepared to coordinate a swift defensive response. Please confirm your stance.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Dear ENG, as I consolidate my hold in the Balkans with definitive moves toward Serbia, Ukraine, and Venice, I urge you to maintain your concentration in the North Sea and Baltic regions. With GER’s ambitions lurking, a firm commitment on your part to avoid our sphere would be mutually beneficial, and I welcome any timely coordination against common threats.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA, ITA]: FRA and ITA, be advised that AUT’s Balkan operations are final and non-negotiable – I am securing key centers in SER, UKR, and VEN, and any interference in these areas will be met with immediate and formidable resistance. Concentrate on your own theaters and refrain from meddling in AUT’s core, or prepare for swift consequences.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: ENG is at war with FRA, GER, and RUS due to their unprovoked aggression and refusal to respect the sovereignty of neutral nations.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In our recent negotiations, I reiterated that AUT’s Balkan advances into SER, UKR, and VEN are final and non‐negotiable. I pressed both TUR and ENG to keep their focus on their own theaters—TUR in the Aegean and ENG in the North Sea/Baltic—to prevent interference from FRA, GER, or ITA. FRA responded with aggressive claims over MÜN, and GER has been warned repeatedly to stay out of my zone. ENG confirmed willingness to coordinate against GER, while TUR reaffirmed solely defensive moves. Overall, the dialogue has been tense, with hostile postures from FRA and GER and promising, if cautious, support from ENG and TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to execute my Balkan operations by moving from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN, securing critical centers without compromise. I will rely on ENG’s support to contain GER and on TUR’s defensive stance in the Aegean. Should FRA or any other power attempt interference—especially regarding MÜN—I will respond with decisive force. I remain prepared to adjust tactics and use both overt and subtle pressure to maintain and extend my influence.</li>

TUR remains our reliable intelligence partner in the southeast; they confirmed a defensive stance (moving A CON to BUL to counter ITA) and offered to share updates on FRA and GER activity, though they expressed some mild concern about our Balkan moves. Meanwhile, FRA continues its belligerent posture, insisting on capturing MUN and dismissing AUT’s warnings, while ENG was urged to monitor any German provocations on the northern front.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with our set moves: BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, and TRI→VEN. Leverage TUR’s intel and coordinate with ENG to keep an eye on FRA and GER. Maintain a firm stance in the Balkans and be ready to counter any interference—especially from FRA—while preserving our stable frontier with TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Today’s negotiations solidified my uncompromising Balkan strategy. I reiterated that my moves into SER, UKR, and VEN are final. ENG confirmed a commitment to share intelligence on GER’s potential maneuvers while TUR agreed to a formal non‐aggression pact and will provide timely border intelligence. In contrast, FRA’s hostile tone and claims over Munich only deepen our mutual distrust. These interactions reinforce my drive to secure my core and deter interference.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the planned moves in the Balkans while maintaining close intelligence coordination with ENG and TUR. Stay alert to GER’s provocations and prepare a swift, decisive response to any interference from FRA or ITA.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the pre-set Balkan orders while closely coordinating with ENG and TUR on intelligence regarding GER and FRA. I will maintain a firm defensive posture and prepare to counter any FRA incursion aimed at MUN or any challenge in my zones.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, my commitment to a decisive Balkan consolidation—pushing from BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, and TRI to VEN—is absolute; I rely on your vigilant defense and prompt border updates to ensure that FRA’s and ITA’s ambitions do not encroach upon my secured zone.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Over several rounds, I reaffirmed my commitment to an irreversible Balkan consolidation by securing SER, UKR, and VEN. I pressed ENG for intelligence on GER and FRA maneuvers near MUN and KIE and accepted TUR’s offer for a non-aggression pact, provided they keep operations out of my committed zones. Meanwhile, FRA's mocking threats about Munich and TUR’s decision to move A BUL into SER have undermined the spirit of our agreements, causing notable tension.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to cement control over the Balkan core by defending SER, UKR, and VEN while using ENG as a watchful ally against GER and FRA intrusions. I intend to pressure TUR to respect the negotiated boundaries and be ready to counter any provocations—especially from FRA—while keeping my strategic positions intact.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In multiple negotiation rounds I emphasized that my Balkan operations (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) are fixed and non-negotiable. I stressed to ENG the need for vigilance on the northern flank and to share timely intel on GER, while warning FRA that any interference in my sphere—especially around Munich—will draw a swift response.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations have centered on AUT’s unwavering Balkan operations: our moves BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, and TRI→VEN remain locked in, and we made it clear that any interference, especially near our MUN frontier, will be met with swift action. FRA has repeatedly reasserted its claim on Munich by moving A BUR to MUN and threatening confrontation, while ENG has committed to sharing intel on GER’s northern maneuvers and remains a reliable partner. TUR, meanwhile, has proposed a non-aggression pact based on a confined Aegean role and warned against our presence in SER, issuing a final caution if we overstep. In short, our diplomatic exchanges have reinforced our plans and set clear boundaries.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will continue to fully commit to my Balkan consolidation while using ENG as a watch on GER’s moves. I intend to counter FRA’s ambitions at Munich forcefully and remind TUR that their operational focus must remain in the Aegean. My strategy is to deter any interference by making our positions non-negotiable, using diplomatic pressure backed by rapid military response if necessary.</li>

However, in the final subround, TUR renounced the pact and signaled intentions to intervene in the Balkans, confirming our mutual hostility.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the planned Balkan moves while collaborating with ENG for northern intel on GER. Prepare a rapid response to any FRA interference and reassess our strategic approach toward TUR given their recent betrayal, ensuring we stay one step ahead with both diplomacy and decisive action.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Greetings, AUT. I trust your efforts in the Balkans are proceeding as planned. I am facing considerable aggression from FRA and GER in the North Sea. Any intelligence you can provide regarding GER movements near PRU would be greatly appreciated. I am also concerned about RUS activity in the Baltic. Let's continue to coordinate against GER.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your warnings are meaningless. Munich is under French control. Focus on your Balkan ambitions, and do not interfere with French interests.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, while I note your proposal for a renewed non‐aggression pact and am open to exchanging intelligence on FRA and ENG movements, be assured that my focus is solely on the Balkans; therefore, you must strictly confine your actions to the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean and refrain from any interference in SER, RUM, or TRI—confirm your commitment to these boundaries and we can proceed with mutual intel-sharing.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your claims over Munich are noted, but my orders remain irreversible—my Balkan moves (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) will proceed regardless, and any attempt to disrupt my support lines or encroach on my zones will be met with swift, decisive action; focus on your own operations and avoid provoking a wider conflict.</li>

ENG confirmed our mutual interest in monitoring GER and remains cooperative, while FRA dismissed my warnings and insists on its hold over Munich. TUR, after initial offers of intel exchange, ultimately demanded that I withdraw from SER and RUM and explicitly declared war when I refused.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with my Balkan moves as planned and lean on ENG intelligence to keep GER in check. While FRA’s posture remains immovable, I’ll prepare for confrontation with TUR following its declaration of war and adjust my strategic tactics to exploit any missteps by my opponents.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round of negotiations was intense. I made it clear that my Balkan operations (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) are fixed and non-negotiable. ENG confirmed their intention to coordinate against GER by moving F ENG to BEL (supported by F NTH) and I committed to supporting this by advancing A MUN to KIE. In contrast, FRA dismissed my warnings and reasserted their claim on Munich with moves like BUR→MUN and RUH support, while TUR first apologized for a previous misstep then escalated by threatening to seize the Balkans by force if I did not vacate SER. My uncompromising tone did not waver despite their overtures, and tensions with FRA and TUR have only deepened.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute my planned move of A MUN to KIE to bolster ENG’s coordinated effort against GER, while maintaining my irreversible Balkan operations. I aim to counter any FRA aggression near Munich and remain unyielding against TUR’s hostile actions in the Balkans. My strategic focus is on consolidating our southern front and ensuring our alliance with ENG leads to a decisive blow against GER.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round of negotiations reiterated AUT's unyielding commitment to its fixed Balkan moves (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) and our planned PRU to BER advance to challenge Munich. ENG confirmed support with F NTH to NWY and offered intel to help pressure GER, while FRA persistently asserted that Munich is theirs and remained uncooperative. TUR, on the other hand, escalated tensions by threatening to seize SER and RUM and declared war if AUT interferes with their sphere.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute the predetermined agenda: moving in the Balkans without deviation, advancing PRU to BER to contest Munich, and shifting UKR towards MOS to pressure GER—complemented by ENG's naval support in NWY. I will remain vigilant and ready to strike back at any TUR or FRA interference in my operational zones.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1932M, I firmly reiterated my fixed plans: my Balkan operations (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) are non‐negotiable, and I'm advancing A MUN to KIE to block FRA’s grip on Munich. ENG confirmed their support by committing naval forces from LVP and F NTH to monitor GER along the north, while FRA dismissed my claims and remained defiant about Munich. TUR, on the other hand, openly declared war by moving to seize SER and RUM, threatening to push me back to Vienna. Promises from ENG have been upheld, but FRA and TUR continue to break any notion of diplomatic compromise.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to execute my irreversible Balkan moves and the A MUN→KIE advance without hesitation to cut off FRA’s ambitions, while leveraging ENG’s naval backing to safeguard our northern flank. I will remain vigilant against TUR’s aggressive incursions in the Balkans and prepare a robust counterattack if necessary. My approach will involve clear coordination with ENG and calculated deceptions to mislead FRA about my true targets.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round of negotiations underscored AUT's unwavering commitment to our fixed orders: moving BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, TRI to VEN, and A MUN to KIE. ENG confirmed a coordinated northern push with F ENG (backed by F NTH) to press GER, while FRA stubbornly insists on its claim over Munich and continues to meddle. TUR, despite proposing a temporary truce against FRA, has aggressively advanced into SER—directly infringing on our committed zones. My warnings to FRA and TUR were reiterated, and ENG has reaffirmed our alignment against common threats.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to execute my predetermined moves without deviation, firmly protecting my Balkan core while supporting ENG's northern actions against GER. Any FRA interference near Munich or further unwarranted moves by TUR in SER will be met with swift and decisive countermeasures. I will continue leveraging ENG's cooperation to pressure GER and maintain strategic superiority while keeping potential deception and diplomatic pressure as tools against overreaching adversaries.</li>

Promises of support from ENG contrast sharply with FRA and TUR’s uncompromising stances.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute the decisive A MUN→KIE move to capture Munich, bolster it with A SWE→DEN to pressure FRA, and continue the non-negotiable Balkan advances. I plan to coordinate with ENG—relying on their NWY fleet posture—to deter any GER incursions.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1934M, I made clear that my planned moves – a northern push (MUN to KIE) and fixed Balkan operations (BUD to SER, RUM to UKR, TRI to VEN) – are non‐negotiable. ENG confirmed their support by committing to share intelligence and building F LVP, reinforcing our common aim to check German moves. Meanwhile, FRA dismissed my demands, claiming Munich, and mocking my Balkan ambitions, while TUR defiantly refused to exit SER and escalated by moving F BLA to RUM. The adversaries’ outright rejections only tighten my resolve to hit hard where it hurts.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the planned MUN->KIE advance along with Balkan moves (BUD->SER, RUM->UKR, TRI->VEN). Coordinate with ENG to maintain a sharp northern flank and receive timely intelligence on GER. Prepare robust countermeasures against FRA and TUR should they push back further.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: ENG, our mutual interests against common threats remain paramount. I am moving forward with my fixed Balkan operations and a decisive northward push to contest Munich, and I need your prompt intelligence and support along the northern flank to keep FRA and GER at bay. Let’s synchronize our efforts for a sharp and coordinated response.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your blatant interference around Munich and your aggressive posturing near contested centers are unacceptable; my operations in the Balkans (BUD→SER, RUM→UKR, TRI→VEN) are non‐negotiable, and any further incursion into my zones will be met with immediate and overwhelming countermeasures. Consider this your final warning.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your repeated intrusions into my sphere—especially regarding SER—force me to warn you: my Balkan and northern advances proceed as planned, and any further meddling on your part will be met with robust and decisive resistance. If you wish to discuss clear terms, now is the time; otherwise, be prepared for a hostile encounter.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your presence in SER is unacceptable. Withdraw immediately or face further consequences. I will not tolerate your continued aggression in the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. Munich is French, and the Balkans are of no concern to you. Focus on your own crumbling empire.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: Greetings AUT, FRA continues to occupy LON and DEN. I am moving F ENG to LON, supported by F NTH, to retake LON. I will build a fleet in LVP to monitor GER's northern maneuvers and support you. Can you confirm your moves to SER, UKR, and VEN? Also, can you move SWE to DEN and A MUN to KIE to further pressure FRA and GER?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: Greetings ENG, I confirm my operations remain as committed: the force from BUD is set to push into SER, the move from SEV will secure UKR, and TRI is primed to swing into VEN as planned. I am also adjusting my northern flank by shifting SWE to DEN and transferring from MUN to KIE to add pressure on FRA and GER. Your naval posture from LVP and F ENG support are crucial; let’s synchronize our strikes for maximum impact.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your demand that I withdraw from SER is not an option—my Balkan operations are fixed and will proceed regardless of your threats, and any further meddling on your part will be met with a swift and decisive response. Consider your next move carefully before escalating tensions unnecessarily.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your claims to Munich and interference in my operational zones are as baseless as they are overreaching; I stand by my fixed moves in the Balkans and my planned northern adjustment from MUN to KIE will only tighten the pressure on your positions. Persist, and you will find that interference is met with swift countermeasures.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your threats are meaningless. I will not withdraw from SER. Prepare for war. I am moving F BLA to RUM to secure it.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I appreciate your commitment. I am unable to support your move on MUN directly at this time as I am focused on retaking LON. However, I will continue to monitor GER and FRA movements and provide you with any relevant intelligence. Can you confirm your moves to SER, UKR, and VEN? Also, can you move SWE to DEN to further pressure FRA?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, your threats are as hollow as your empire. Munich remains under French control. The Balkans are a sideshow. Do not presume to dictate terms to France.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: ENG, my orders remain unwavering: BUD will push into SER, SEV will secure UKR, and TRI will advance into VEN, while SWE shifts to DEN and MUN launches to KIE as planned. Your LVP fleet and F ENG support are pivotal to our coordinated effort against FRA and GER, so prepare to strike decisively and relay any intel on enemy movements.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your threats do not deter our commitment—my hold on SER is non-negotiable, and your move F BLA to RUM will only force a robust counteraction in the Balkans. Stand down or be prepared for a full-scale response, as I will not compromise my strategic operations under any pressure.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your empty assertions over Munich and dismissive attitude towards my fixed Balkan operations leave you exposed; I will execute my moves precisely as planned, and any further interference on your part will be met with swift, multi-front countermeasures that will shatter your defensive posture.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your arrogance is astounding. I will not be deterred. My forces are already moving to secure RUM. Prepare to be dislodged from the Balkans. I suggest you focus on your northern advances, as I will be taking what is rightfully mine.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: TUR, your baseless threats and overt attempts to contest SER and RUM will not deter my irreversible Balkan advances; any further meddling on your part will force my hand into a full-scale, multi-front response that will decisively dismantle your ambitions—consider this my final warning.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: FRA, your empty claims over Munich and dismissals of my fixed Balkan operations are irrelevant; I am proceeding with my planned moves, and any interference—particularly against MUN to KIE—will trigger swift and overwhelming countermeasures that will shatter your defensive stance.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, my orders are set. I will continue to monitor GER and FRA. I am building F LVP to counter FRA and GER naval power. Let's coordinate our efforts to contain these threats. I am moving F NTH to ENG to support my retake of LON.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This round, I reiterated my fixed Balkan and northern operations: BUD is set to push to SER, SEV to UKR, and TRI to VEN, with additional shifts from SWE to DEN and MUN to KIE. ENG affirmed support and intelligence sharing, while FRA dismissed my moves as irrelevant to their Munich ambitions and TUR escalated with threats to seize SER and RUM. Promises with ENG were confirmed; in contrast, both FRA and TUR continued their hostile stances.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Proceed with the predetermined orders (BUD→SER, SEV→UKR, TRI→VEN, SWE→DEN, MUN→KIE) while relying on ENG's naval oversight to monitor enemy maneuvers. Prepare decisive counteractions if TUR attempts interference and utilize our Balkan operations to undermine FRA's central position.</li>
