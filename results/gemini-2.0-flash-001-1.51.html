<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings, Italy. Given our proximity, it seems wise to establish a dialogue. I propose we discuss our mutual interests in the Adriatic and Balkan regions. Perhaps we can find a way to coexist peacefully, or even cooperate to our mutual benefit. What are your initial thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: To Germany, I am writing to propose a non-aggression pact. We share a border and it would be beneficial to both of us to focus on other areas for expansion. What are your thoughts on this proposal?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: To Turkey, I am writing to propose a non-aggression pact. We are far apart and it would be beneficial to both of us to focus on other areas for expansion. What are your thoughts on this proposal?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are neighbors with overlapping interests. Let us avoid conflict. We propose a neutral stance towards each other. We will not move into Galicia if you do not move into Rumania. Agreed?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings, Austria. I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am interested in securing my eastern border and focusing on other matters. Perhaps we can discuss the disposition of Trieste later, but for now, let us maintain the peace. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful coexistence. We have shared borders and it would be wise to avoid conflict early on. Perhaps we can even coordinate against Russia in the future? What are your intentions regarding Bohemia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, greetings. We share a border and potential interests in the Balkans. I am open to discussing a possible understanding regarding our spheres of influence in the region. Perhaps we can agree on a division of territories to avoid conflict. What are your initial thoughts on this?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I agree to a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. Let's focus on securing our borders and building trust. Regarding Trieste, we can discuss its disposition later, but for now, peace is paramount. I propose we coordinate our movements in the Adriatic to avoid any misunderstandings. What are your thoughts on this?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I agree to a period of peaceful coexistence. Coordinating against Russia is an interesting proposition, but let's establish a solid foundation of trust first. Regarding Bohemia, I have no immediate intentions there. My focus is on the Balkans. What are your plans for Denmark?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I accept your proposal for a neutral stance. I agree not to move into Rumania if you do not move into Galicia. Let's maintain this understanding to avoid unnecessary conflict. I am curious about your intentions in Turkey.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I also accept your proposal for a non-aggression pact. To ensure stability, I propose we agree on spheres of influence. I will not interfere in Bohemia if you do not interfere in Silesia. This will prevent any accidental conflicts. What do you say?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I accept your proposal for a non-aggression pact. Let's focus on our respective expansion plans without interference. I am interested in Serbia and Greece. What are your intentions in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, thank you for your response. I agree that a dialogue is wise. I am primarily interested in securing Trieste for Italy. However, I am willing to offer concessions elsewhere in exchange for your cooperation. Perhaps we can discuss the disposition of Tyrol as well. What are your thoughts on a potential trade: Trieste for Tyrol, with a guarantee of non-aggression for the next two years?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we appreciate your willingness to avoid conflict. However, a simple neutral stance is not enough. We propose a more concrete agreement: Russia will support Austria's move into Serbia if Austria supports Russia's move into Rumania. This will secure both our flanks and allow for expansion. What do you say?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate your directness. Trieste is a core territory for Austria, and Tyrol is strategically important. I am not inclined to trade them. However, I am willing to offer support for your expansion into Albania in exchange for a guarantee of non-aggression for the next two years and your support for my move into Serbia. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I accept your proposal for spheres of influence. I agree not to interfere in Silesia if you do not interfere in Bohemia. This will prevent accidental conflicts and allow us to focus on our respective goals. I am curious about your intentions in Scandinavia.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I am hesitant to commit to a joint move into Serbia and Rumania. It seems too aggressive at this early stage. However, I am willing to consider a more limited agreement. I will support your move into Rumania if you support my move into Serbia in the following turn, provided the situation on the ground allows for it. This gives us both flexibility and avoids immediate conflict. What do you say?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I appreciate your willingness to coexist peacefully. Since you have no immediate intentions in Bohemia, I will focus on Denmark and Holland. I propose we maintain a neutral stance towards each other's expansion efforts for now. If Russia becomes too aggressive, we can revisit the idea of coordinating against them. Does this sound acceptable?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are disappointed by your lack of ambition. A simple neutral stance benefits no one. We reiterate our offer: Russia will support Austria's move into Serbia if Austria supports Russia's move into Rumania. This is a win-win scenario. Consider it carefully.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your agreement to a non-aggression pact. Coordinating movements in the Adriatic is a good idea. I propose that my fleet in Naples will remain in the Ionian Sea, and my army in Venice will remain in Venice, unless we agree otherwise. This should alleviate any concerns about my intentions in Trieste for the time being. What specific movements are you planning in the Adriatic?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am moving A CON to BUL. This is within my sphere of influence in the Balkans. I am also moving A SMY to ARM. I expect you to respect my expansion plans. What are your next moves?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I appreciate the agreement on the non-aggression pact and the coordination in the Adriatic. I will ensure that my fleet in Trieste remains in the Adriatic Sea, and my army in Vienna will remain in Vienna, unless we agree otherwise. I am moving A BUD to SER. This should alleviate any concerns about my intentions in Trieste for the time being.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, I appreciate your willingness to coexist peacefully. I will focus on the Balkans. I propose we maintain a neutral stance towards each other's expansion efforts for now. I am moving A VIE to TRI. Does this sound acceptable?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I am moving A BUD to SER. I am moving A VIE to TRI. I am moving F TRI to ALB. I am not moving into Rumania. I expect you to respect my expansion plans. What are your next moves?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I cannot agree to supporting your move into Serbia. My ambitions lie elsewhere. However, I will maintain the non-aggression pact for the next two years if you agree to cede Trieste to Italy. This is my final offer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we accept your counter-proposal. We will support your move into Serbia next turn if the situation allows, provided you support our move into Rumania this turn. Let us proceed with this limited agreement and see where it leads.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, I appreciate your understanding regarding spheres of influence. I will focus on Denmark and Holland, and you can focus on the Balkans. Let us maintain a neutral stance towards each other's expansion efforts for now. This is my final communication for this round.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am moving A CON to BUL and A SMY to ARM. This is within my sphere of influence in the Balkans. I expect you to respect my expansion plans. I am not interested in Serbia or Greece at this time. What are your next moves?</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No prior moves to summarize.
Established non-aggression pacts with GER and ITA. ITA wants Trieste, but I refused to cede it. Agreed to a limited agreement with RUS: I will support their move into Rumania next turn if they support my move into Serbia this turn, provided the situation allows. TUR is moving into BUL and ARM, claiming it's within their sphere of influence. GER will focus on Denmark and Holland, maintaining neutrality with me.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My primary goal is to expand into the Balkans, specifically Serbia. I will use the agreement with RUS to facilitate this, while maintaining a defensive posture against ITA. I will monitor TUR's movements closely. I will maintain a neutral stance with GER, focusing on my own expansion. I will continue to probe ITA for weaknesses and potential opportunities to gain an advantage. I will honor the non-aggression pacts with GER and ITA for now, but will be ready to break them if necessary to achieve my objectives. I will move A BUD to SER, A VIE to TRI, and F TRI to ALB.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your defensive posture. However, I must reiterate my need to secure Tunis. I assure you, my moves are not directed at you.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Greetings, RUS. Your sudden reversal is noted. I am not moving too aggressively; I am securing my border. Your move to BLA is concerning. What are your intentions there?

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Greetings, TUR. I am open to discussing spheres of influence in the Balkans. However, I will not cede SER. What specific division do you propose?

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings, ITA. I am concerned about your insistence on Tunis. It is far from Italy and could destabilize the region.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I moved A BUD to SER, A VIE to TRI, and F TRI to ALB, focusing on the Balkans as agreed with GER and RUS. ENG, FRA, GER, ITA, RUS, and TUR all made moves.
Initial agreements with RUS and GER fell apart. RUS became hostile due to my move into SER and moved to BLA. ITA insisted on Tunis, offering support for SER in return, but I rejected it. TUR proposed a division of the Balkans, which I also rejected. All relationships have deteriorated.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to defend SER against RUS. I will break the non-aggression pact with ITA and prepare for potential conflict. I will also prepare for conflict with TUR. My moves will be A SER H, A TRI S A SER, F ALB - ADR.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1901, I moved A TRI to SER and F ALB to ADR. I built A BUD in Winter 1901.
I attempted to negotiate with RUS to withdraw from RUM and the Black Sea, but they refused and consider our agreements null. I negotiated with ITA for support in GRE in exchange for supporting their move to TUN, but they insist on TRI. I negotiated with TUR regarding the Balkans, but they moved into RUM, which I find unacceptable. I am moving A SER to GRE.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My primary goal is to expand into the Balkans, specifically Greece. I will support ITA's move into Tunis to secure their support for my move into Greece. I will resist TUR's encroachment into the Balkans and will consider further action depending on their response to my move into Greece. I will defend against RUS aggression. I will move A SER to GRE, A TRI to ALB, F ADR supports A TRI to ALB, A BUD supports A SER to GRE.</li>

Negotiations with TUR failed due to their refusal to withdraw from Rumania.

I will offer you a chance to de-escalate: you withdraw from Rumania, and I will not interfere with your ambitions in Turkey. This is your last chance for a peaceful resolution. I will be moving A VIE to BOH.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1903, I moved A TRI to TYR and F ADR to VEN, holding VIE. In Winter, I had no builds or disbandments.
Negotiations this round were hostile. I attempted to deter ITA, RUS, and TUR from Balkan aggression, but all three powers rejected my demands and offers. ITA is fixated on Trieste. TUR refuses to cede Bulgaria or withdraw from Rumania. RUS is determined to secure its Balkan interests. No agreements were reached, and war seems inevitable with all three powers.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My intent is to prepare for war against ITA, RUS, and TUR. I will move A VIE to BOH, A TYR to MUN, and F ADR to ION to position myself for conflict.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1904, I moved A VIE to BUD, A TYR to VIE, and F ADR to TRI. These moves were defensive, anticipating aggression from Italy, Russia, and Turkey. I aimed to consolidate my forces and protect my core territories.
Negotiations this turn were largely unsuccessful. I engaged in hostile exchanges with Italy, Russia, and Turkey, all of whom I perceive as threats. Turkey offered a compromise but refused to withdraw from Rumania and Bulgaria. Russia remained aggressive and threatening. Italy's aggression in the Adriatic remains a primary concern. No agreements were reached, and the situation remains tense.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My intent is to defend Austria-Hungary against the encroaching powers of Italy, Russia, and Turkey. I will focus on consolidating my forces and preparing for war. I will continue to probe for weaknesses in my enemies' positions and exploit any opportunities that arise. I intend to move A BUD to SER, A VIE to RUM, and F TRI to ADR. These moves are designed to defend against Turkish and Russian aggression while maintaining a presence in the Adriatic.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Austria moved to secure the Balkans, supporting Serbia and moving into Albania and Trieste. This was met with hostility from Italy, Russia, and Turkey, who also made aggressive moves in the region.
Negotiations with Italy, Russia, and Turkey have failed. Italy insists on Trieste, offering Albania in return, which is unacceptable. Russia is moving into Rumania and refuses to withdraw. Turkey demands Rumania and offers Serbia, which is also unacceptable. All three powers are hostile and preparing for war.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Prepare for war against Italy, Russia, and Turkey. Defend Austrian territories and resist their aggression. No promises were made or broken, as no agreements were reached. I will order the following moves:

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn was Fall 1905. No moves were made by AUT. TUR moved A SEV R ARM. ENG, FRA, RUS, and TUR made adjustments in Winter 1905.
Negotiations this turn focused on the Balkans. I attempted to deter TUR and RUS from aggressive moves in the region, particularly in Rumania and Trieste. Both powers refused to back down and declared their intention to continue their expansion. ITA also declared war. No agreements were reached, and the situation has escalated to open conflict with ITA, TUR, and RUS.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My intent is to defend Austrian territories and resist Turkish and Russian expansion in the Balkans. I will move A VIE to TRI, A BUD to SER, and F ADR to ALB to defend against the expected Turkish attack on Trieste and to contest Serbia. I anticipate a difficult fight and will look for opportunities to exploit weaknesses in the RUS-TUR alliance.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1906, I moved A VIE to TRI, A BUD to SER, and F ADR to ALB. These moves were intended to secure my borders and exert influence in the Balkans. However, they have been met with hostility from Italy, Russia, and Turkey, who are all encroaching on my sphere of influence.
I attempted to negotiate with Italy, Russia, and Turkey to de-escalate tensions in the Balkans. I offered Italy Trieste in exchange for peace and cooperation against Russia and Turkey, but Italy rejected my offer and declared war. I demanded that Russia and Turkey withdraw from Rumania and Serbia, but they refused and continued their aggression. All negotiations failed, and war is imminent with ITA, RUS, and TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My intent is to defend Austria-Hungary from the aggression of Italy, Russia, and Turkey. I will move my forces to protect my borders and counter their advances. I will also seek alliances with other powers to contain Russia and Turkey in the Balkans. I will attempt to hold TRI against ITA. I will attempt to dislodge RUS from RUM. I will attempt to contain TUR in SER and ALB. I will consider an alliance with GER or FRA if they are willing to support my efforts.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1906, I moved A BUD to SER and F ADR to VEN, attempting to secure the Balkans. Italy moved aggressively into Austrian territory, while Turkey also advanced into the region. Russia remained passive. In Winter 1906, Russia ordered A WAR to disband.
Negotiations this round were a complete failure. I attempted to assert Austrian dominance in the Balkans, demanding that Italy, Russia, and Turkey withdraw their forces. All three powers refused and issued counter-threats. No agreements were reached, and the situation has deteriorated into open hostility with all three powers.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Given the failure of negotiations and the aggressive moves by Italy and Turkey, my immediate priority is to defend Austrian territory. I will attempt to dislodge the Turkish unit from Trieste and contain Italian advances. I will also prepare for potential conflict with Russia in the east. I will move A VIE to TRI, A BUD to SER, and F ADR to VEN.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Fall 1907, I moved A VIE to BOH, A BUD to RUM, and F ADR to TRI. In Winter, I ordered A BOH to disband. My moves were largely unsuccessful, as I failed to gain any ground and faced setbacks in the Balkans.
I attempted to negotiate with GER for a joint effort against FRA, offering support for an attack on MUN. I tried to negotiate with RUS for a truce and a division of the Balkans, but RUS rejected all offers and continued their aggression. I offered ITA ALB in exchange for TRI and a non-aggression pact, but received no commitment. I also attempted to negotiate with TUR, offering to cede SER if they withdrew from RUM, but this was also unsuccessful. No promises were made or broken, as no agreements were reached.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Given the failure of negotiations and the continued aggression from RUS and TUR, my primary objective is to defend my territories and consolidate my position. I will move A BUD to BOH to defend against potential attacks from GER or FRA. I will move F ADR to TRI to defend against ITA. I will support my units as best as possible.</li>
