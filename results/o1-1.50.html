<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings from Vienna. I propose peace on our border: I won’t move on Venice if you don’t march on Trieste. Let’s cooperate and split the Balkans. I’m eyeing Serbia and Rum; you can look west or perhaps push towards Greece if that appeals. Your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Esteemed Tsar, I am open to a friendly demarcation of Galicia—no conflict, no surprises. If you accept a DMZ or a pre-arranged bounce there, we can focus energy elsewhere. Let’s carve up the Balkans in a way that benefits us both and keeps the Turk in check.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: My friend in Istanbul, let us keep our border tranquil. I intend Serbia for myself. You can secure Bulgaria. We can coordinate to ensure Russia and Italy do not encroach on our shared interests. A strong Austro-Turkish understanding can dominate the southeast.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am focused on expansion elsewhere and wish to avoid conflict with you. Perhaps we can even coordinate against a common foe later. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria, Germany suggests a period of peaceful co-existence. We are both landlocked and have more to gain by focusing on other powers. Perhaps we can even coordinate against a common foe in the future. What are your intentions in Bohemia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am willing to discuss the Balkans. Perhaps we can come to an understanding regarding our spheres of influence in the region. I am particularly interested in Bulgaria. What are your intentions there?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we note your presence in Galicia. We propose a discussion regarding our mutual borders. Perhaps we can come to an understanding that benefits both our nations. What are your intentions in Galicia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To ALL, England announces its intention to maintain the balance of power in Europe. We seek peaceful relations with all nations and will act in the best interests of stability and prosperity. We are open to dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual concern.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your openness to a non-aggression pact is welcome. I will not move on Venice if you likewise respect Trieste. I plan to take Serbia for my immediate expansion. Let us keep each other informed as we grow; the Balkans are ripe for cooperation if we keep our borders quiet.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I propose we avoid tensions over Galicia. If you plan to move from Warsaw, let us coordinate a bounce so neither gains the upper hand, or simply opt for a DMZ. My main focus is south, and I’m open to friendly terms that let us both expand peacefully.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I will be moving for Serbia and encourage you to claim Bulgaria. Let us maintain calm borders and collaborate to check Russia’s ambitions. With coordination, we can ensure stability and mutual benefit in the Balkans.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your proposal is intriguing. I agree that a strong Austro-Turkish understanding can dominate the southeast. I am willing to cede Serbia to you in exchange for your support in securing Rumania. This would give me a vital supply center and secure my northern flank. What do you say?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal is intriguing. Peace on our border is acceptable for now. I agree not to move on Trieste if you don't move on Venice. Splitting the Balkans is a possibility, but I am also interested in Greece. Let's discuss further coordination. What are your specific plans for Serbia and Rumania?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are amenable to a DMZ in Galicia. We propose a pre-arranged bounce, with neither of us attempting to occupy the territory. Regarding the Balkans, we are interested in discussing a division of influence that benefits both our nations. What specific territories are you interested in securing?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your offer is compelling. Let’s finalize: I’ll secure Serbia while you claim Bulgaria. Then we can coordinate in the fall to help you take Rumania, ensuring we both gain from weakening Russia. Together, we lock down the Balkans in our favor.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I confirm I won’t move on Venice if you remain clear of Trieste. I plan to take Serbia and am fine with you pursuing Greece. Let’s keep a strong border understanding and enjoy mutually beneficial expansion without entangling each other.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I accept a DMZ in Galicia. I won’t move there if you don’t. My sights are set on the Balkans, so I have no desire to threaten your position. Let’s maintain peace on our border while we each expand elsewhere.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we agree to a pre-arranged bounce in Galicia. We will move our army from Warsaw to Ukraine, and you can move your army from Galicia to Bohemia. Regarding the Balkans, we are interested in discussing a division of influence. What specific territories are you interested in securing, and what are you willing to offer in return?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to your terms. I will not move on Trieste if you respect Venice. I am interested in Greece as well. Let's coordinate our moves in the Balkans. I suggest we both take a Balkan center this turn. You take Serbia, and I will move into Greece. Does that sound agreeable?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I agree to your terms. I will move to secure Bulgaria. Let us coordinate our moves to ensure Russia does not interfere. I propose we support each other's moves in the Balkans this turn. I will support your move into Serbia if you support my move into Bulgaria.</li>

<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Agreed, I will move on Serbia while you take Bulgaria. This sets us both up to keep Russia in check. We can coordinate further in the fall to help you move on Rumania if it remains ripe for the taking.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I confirm my commitment not to move on Venice if you stay clear of Trieste. I will secure Serbia, and you are free to pursue Greece. Let’s keep our border quiet and stand ready to assist each other’s expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I will honor our agreement regarding Galicia and will not move there this spring. My focus remains on the southern Balkans, so I trust we can maintain friendly relations as we both expand.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we acknowledge your acceptance of a DMZ in Galicia. We will move our army from Warsaw to Ukraine, and we expect you to refrain from moving into Galicia. We will maintain peace on our border while we each expand elsewhere. We will be watching your moves in the Balkans closely.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, excellent. I will move into Greece. You take Serbia. Let's maintain our agreement regarding Venice and Trieste. I look forward to our continued cooperation in the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, excellent! I will move to Bulgaria. Let's ensure our support is locked in. A CON - BUL and A BUD supports A CON - BUL. F ANK supports A CON. Do you agree to support my move into Bulgaria?</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No previous moves took place as this is the first move of the game. All powers have simply positioned themselves at their starting locations.
We reached tentative understandings with ITA (non-aggression on Venice–Trieste), TUR (cooperation in the Balkans: I take Serbia, TUR takes Bulgaria), and RUS (a DMZ in Galicia). No major deals have formed with ENG, FRA, or GER yet, though none indicate immediate hostility. Promises hinge on a peaceful Austrian–Italian border, a coordinated push with Turkey into the Balkans, and a lack of moves by either Russia or myself into Galicia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to move A BUD to SER, keep Italy at bay by not pressuring Venice, and work with Turkey so we both gain from the Balkans. I will respect the DMZ with Russia by not entering Galicia. These plans bolster my position in the southeast while securing peaceful borders with my neighbors, aiming for a stable foundation for future growth.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings friend! With Trieste legally ours, we’d prefer you to withdraw your army so we can remain at peace. If you stay, we may have no choice but to retake it. We can work together for mutual gain if you return Trieste and focus your expansions elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Good day. Let’s cooperate in the Balkans: I aim to secure Greece while I trust you to shore up Bulgaria. Let’s stand together against Russian encroachment. If we remain coordinated, we can split the region’s spoils without conflict.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Hello! I respectfully propose we maintain our DMZ in Galicia to keep our borders quiet. I ask that you not push further into the Balkans. If you honor this, I’ll reciprocate by avoiding confrontation and focusing on my southern front.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. As agreed, I have moved A WAR to UKR. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to our agreement regarding Galicia. What are your intentions in SER and BUD?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving my army from Trieste to Vienna. This is not an act of aggression, but rather a move to secure the region. I expect you to honor our non-aggression pact and not move on Venice. Let's maintain our neutral stance and avoid conflict.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I trust your advance into Serbia is proceeding as planned. I am moving into Bulgaria. Let us coordinate our efforts to secure the Balkans.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: My friend, your stated move from TRI to VIE is clearly hostile. I urge you to vacate TRI at once—move it to VEN or APU instead. If you march on VIE, I will have no choice but to defend my homeland and reclaim our supply center by force. Maintain peace and we can still cooperate.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Let’s solidify our pact in the Balkans. I intend to sail from ALB to GRE, and trust you to hold BUL. No interference on your end and no contest from me for Bulgaria. We can jointly discourage Russian interference in RUM. If we work together, both our positions will thrive.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Our agreement holds: we will keep GAL neutral as long as you do the same. My focus is on Italy’s intrusion at TRI—I prefer peace in the east. Please confirm your intentions regarding GAL so we can preserve stability on our frontier.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am securing Bulgaria. I suggest you focus on Greece and perhaps consider moving into Rumania to contain the Russian bear. We must be vigilant against their expansionist tendencies.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I understand your concern about Trieste. However, my move to Vienna is not a threat to you. It is merely a strategic repositioning. I propose we maintain our non-aggression pact and focus on our own expansions. Perhaps we can discuss future cooperation in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I appreciate your proposal to maintain the DMZ in Galicia. I intend to keep A UKR in place. However, I am also moving A MOS to SEV, which may appear concerning. This is primarily to exert pressure on Turkey and secure my southern flank. I assure you, my focus remains on the east. What are your intentions in SER and BUD?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your insistence on holding Trieste and threatening Vienna is unacceptable. Withdraw from Trieste or we will retake it by force, and any move on Vienna will be taken as a declaration of war. Abandon these hostile actions, and we can still pursue mutual gains elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I intend to move my fleet from Albania to Greece while you hold fast in Bulgaria. Together, we can contain Russian influence in Rumania and ensure our shared dominance of the Balkans. Let us maintain this united front for our mutual benefit.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We confirm our commitment to the Galicia DMZ. I must focus on Italy’s violation of Austrian sovereignty in Trieste, leaving no desire to expand eastward if you continue to respect our shared border. Let us each secure our spheres without interfering with one another.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your threats are noted. However, I assure you my move to Vienna is not intended as an act of aggression. I am merely securing my position. I propose we maintain our non-aggression pact and focus on our own expansions. If you insist on war, I will be forced to defend myself, and you will find me a formidable opponent. Let's reconsider and find a path to mutual benefit.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am holding Bulgaria. I suggest you move into Greece as planned. I agree that we must discourage Russian interference in Rumania. Perhaps a joint naval presence in the Black Sea would be beneficial in the long term, but for now, let us focus on securing our respective spheres of influence.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I appreciate your commitment to the DMZ in Galicia. I am moving A UKR to GAL. This is not intended as a threat to you, but rather as a strategic repositioning. My primary focus remains on the east and south. I am concerned about Turkey's aggressive expansion. I hope we can continue to maintain peace on our border. What are your intentions regarding Italy's presence in TRI?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your occupation of Trieste and talk of moving on Vienna is a clear threat. We will reclaim Trieste if you do not withdraw. I would still prefer cooperation over conflict, and I urge you to vacate Trieste if you wish to avoid a disastrous war that only benefits our rivals.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Your decision to move into Galicia breaks our DMZ and raises grave concerns. If your true aim is peace, you must reverse this action. My focus remains on Italy’s aggression, but if you make a hostile incursion into our lands, I will have no choice but to respond accordingly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I am proceeding with my fleet into Greece as we discussed. Together, our positions in the Balkans will remain strong if we each hold what we have and keep watch on Rumania. Let us maintain our alliance and contain any threats from Russia or elsewhere.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am holding Bulgaria as agreed. Ensure your fleet moves to Greece. We must present a united front against Russian aggression. I suggest we coordinate our long-term strategy in the Balkans to ensure our mutual dominance. Do not waver.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I have made my decision. I will not withdraw from Trieste or Vienna. Prepare for war. I will crush you.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I appreciate your commitment to the DMZ in Galicia. I am moving A UKR to GAL, but this is not a threat to you. My focus remains on the east and south. I am concerned about Turkey's aggressive expansion. I hope we can continue to maintain peace on our border. I will not interfere with your conflict with Italy in TRI.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, we shifted A BUD to SER, A VIE to BUD, and F TRI to ALB. Italy seized TRI from VEN, Russia took RUM, and Turkey moved into BUL. We ended with A SER, A BUD, F ALB.
We tried to persuade ITA to leave TRI, but they openly threatened war and refused to withdraw. TUR agreed to coordinate in the Balkans, encouraging us to focus on GRE while they hold BUL. RUS initially upheld a DMZ in GAL but is now moving A UKR there, creating new tensions. We reaffirmed a desire for peace with RUS provided they stay nonaggressive, but Italy’s belligerence complicates our diplomacy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will retake TRI from ITA by force if possible. We plan to move F ALB to GRE in coordination with TUR. We will watch RUS carefully after their move to GAL and reserve the right to respond if they threaten our border. Our priority is to secure our homeland and contain ITA’s aggression.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Friend, let us continue our cooperation in the Balkans. I intend to retake Vienna from Italy and will not challenge your position in Rum. If you maintain pressure east while I handle Italy, we can both grow. What do you say to a stable border between us while we drive out the common foe?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I wish to avoid tensions between us. If you keep your forces out of Galicia, I will do the same. Let’s not waste energy fighting each other while more immediate threats exist in the south and west. Are we agreed on preserving our current frontier?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your hold on Vienna threatens my homeland. Withdraw peaceably, or I will have no choice but to attack. I suggest we end this hostility now and find an arrangement that spares further bloodshed. Otherwise, I must act to safeguard my territory.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Greetings friend. I intend to move BUD to SER this turn and would appreciate you leaving it unchallenged so that we can solidify our hold in the Balkans. Italy appears weak and overextended—if we synchronize our efforts, we can slice through their defenses quickly and share the spoils. Let me know your thoughts so we can lock down a solid plan.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: My friend, let us maintain our peaceful border. I will not advance into Galicia if you likewise remain behind your lines. My focus lies westward, dealing with Italy’s intrusions. As long as we respect this agreement, we can avoid unnecessary conflict and instead grow stronger on our own fronts.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: You have no rightful claim to Vienna. If you withdraw from Tyrol and cede Vienna peacefully, we might find a path to mutual benefit.

Let us focus our combined might on Italy rather than collide over one Balkan territory.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your threats toward Budapest and Vienna are rash. If you truly believe you can hold both, you are mistaken. Stand down and withdraw from Tyrol and Vienna, or you will face a united response from those you have needlessly provoked.</li>

Together, we can crush Italy and keep Russia at bay, but we must first avoid clashing over the same target.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We successfully moved A TRI into VIE with support from A BUD, while F GRE sailed to the ION Sea. Italy’s unit retreated from VIE to TYR afterward.
We attempted to secure an agreement with TUR to claim SER ourselves, but TUR insists on taking SER. RUS promises to maintain a DMZ if we do not move into Galicia or Ukraine. ITA refuses diplomacy and vows to seize both VIE and BUD. Despite repeated warnings, ITA remains hostile and TUR appears no longer cooperative regarding the Balkans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to move A BUD to SER to block TUR and secure the Balkans. I will keep peace with RUS by avoiding Galicia or Ukraine. I will work to protect VIE from ITA’s aggression and maintain the F ION for southern defense. Diplomatic pressure on TUR might continue, but we must be ready for conflict if they persist in meddling in Serbia.</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1902M, we secured TUN while holding VIE and SER. ITA tried pushing into VIE and gained TRI, TUR advanced into the Balkans, and RUS shifted north. ENG expanded to NWY and FRA headed to WES; GER solidified positions in STP/NC, DEN, and BOH.
Throughout S1903M talks, ITA demanded we abandon core territories, threatened VIE, and refused to leave TRI. TUR insisted on moving into SER despite our warnings, while simultaneously expressing worry over ITA’s aggression. RUS agreed to uphold a DMZ in GAL and withdrew from RUM, seeking assurances we would not move against them. We sought GER’s assistance in containing ITA, offering to keep our border peaceful in exchange for pressure on ITA’s flank.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to defend VIE and SER against both ITA and TUR while honoring the DMZ with RUS. If TUR actually invades SER, we will treat it as open hostility. We aim to collaborate with GER to contain ITA’s aggression. Our goal is to secure our homeland, hold on to TUN, and keep RUS neutral on our eastern flank.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We remain committed to our DMZ arrangement in Galicia and have no wish for conflict with you. Our focus is on defending our homeland from Italian and Turkish hostility. Let us continue to respect our mutual border and maintain stability in the east.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1903R, Italy retreated from Vienna to Tyrol and Turkey from Greece to Albania. Afterwards, in W1903A, France built two armies (in PAR and MAR), Germany disbanded its army in Bohemia, and Turkey disbanded the army in Albania.
We reaffirmed the DMZ with Russia and asked Germany to help contain Italy. Italy demanded we cede Vienna and Budapest under threat of annihilation, while Turkey insisted on moving into Serbia despite our warnings. Both remain openly hostile, and we have refused to yield.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We fully intend to defend our homeland against Italian and Turkish aggression. We will hold the DMZ with Russia, seeking to keep our eastern border stable. We implore Germany to pressure Italy, allowing us to focus on Turkey’s invasion of Serbia. We will not allow either to overrun our territory.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We recaptured Trieste by forcing Italy’s army to retreat to Venice and held our ground in Greece despite Italy’s push. Our attempt from Bulgaria to Constantinople failed against Turkey’s defense. Overall, we stabilized Trieste but remain threatened by Italy in the south and Turkey in the east.
We repeatedly pressed Turkey to avoid Serbia and focus on Russia, but Turkey insisted on securing Serbia, preventing any real truce. Meanwhile, we upheld our pact with Russia to keep Galicia demilitarized, agreeing to contain Turkey. Italy continued to demand our surrender, threatening Trieste and Tunis. We refused, maintaining our resolve to defend our holdings.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will fortify Trieste and hold our lines against Italy’s advances. We will maintain the DMZ with Russia to secure our eastern flank while keeping our forces ready to confront Turkey if it encroaches further into the Balkans. Our core objective remains preserving our current possessions and punishing any attacks from Italy or Turkey.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We confirm our commitment to the DMZ in Galicia and will not enter Ukraine or Rumania as long as you keep your forces out of Galicia.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1904R, ENG’s fleet retreated from NWY to NTH. In W1904A, we built an army in BUD to strengthen our defenses, while others made minor adjustments (e.g., ENG disbanded A YOR, GER built A MUN, ITA disbanded A TYR). No direct clashes occurred, but tensions remained high.
We refused TUR’s demands to cede Serbia or Bulgaria and threatened to ally with RUS and others if TUR persisted. ITA insisted on taking Trieste and Tunis, escalating omens of conflict. RUS reaffirmed the DMZ in Galicia and pledged help against TUR, while GER agreed to pressure ITA if we supported their broader aims in Bohemia and Silesia. We promised to stay out of GAL, collaborate with RUS against TUR, and coordinate with GER against ITA.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will hold BUD and VIE to maintain the DMZ with RUS, coordinate an offensive from CON toward SMY to divide TUR, and work with GER to threaten ITA around Tyrol or Venice. We aim to preserve Serbia and Bulgaria at all costs and deny ITA Trieste or Tunis.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your repeated demands that we abandon Constantinople are not acceptable. We maintain our rightful claim there and will not retreat under threat. If you genuinely desire peace, prove it by moving away from Bulgaria, ceasing all aggression toward our Aegean fleet, and respecting our presence in Smyrna. Otherwise, be prepared for the continuation of hostilities.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Kaiser, let us finalize our plan against Italy. I will move A TRI to VEN as you propose, but I ask that any German unit moving to Tyrol or neighboring areas strictly refrain from entering our territory. With clear coordination, Italy will be forced to yield. Confirm your positions, and together we will decisively strike the Italian menace.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We respect your decision to focus on the Black Sea and reaffirm our DMZ in Galicia. We have no designs on Russian territory. We only ask that you continue keeping Turkish units occupied, as it relieves pressure on our own front. By staying true to our separate war efforts against Turkey, we both gain stability and can protect our shared interests.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your resistance is futile. Surrender Trieste and Tunis or face complete annihilation. I will take Vienna next. Your threats are meaningless. Prepare for my attack.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To AUT, I agree to your terms. I will move A BOH to MUN, and I commit to not moving on VIE or TRI. I will use TYR solely to strike at ITA. I expect you to move A TRI to VEN. This coordinated attack should cripple ITA. Do you agree to this pact?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your position in Constantinople is untenable. Russia and I are preparing to attack. I suggest you withdraw and negotiate a peace settlement before it is too late. I am willing to offer you favorable terms if you cooperate. I will not remove my threat to Bulgaria and the Aegean, and I will not recognize your right to hold Smyrna.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last move (S1905M), we advanced A TRI toward Venice, moved A BUD to Serbia, shifted A CON to Smyrna, and repositioned our fleet from Greece to the Aegean. Meanwhile, GER shifted forces to press ITA (moving A BEL to RUH, A BOH to SIL), and ITA tried to strike back by rotating A APU to TUN and exchanging VEN ↔ TRI. RUS moved A RUM to SEV, and TUR maneuvered fleets and armies around the Black Sea region.
We stood firm against ITA’s demands to give up Trieste and Tunis, allying more closely with GER to mount a two-pronged attack on ITA. RUS reasserted a DMZ in Galicia and declined direct support against TUR but kept Turkey occupied in the Black Sea. TUR repeatedly demanded we withdraw from Constantinople, refusing to reduce its threat around Bulgaria and the Aegean. We refused to concede and offered an alliance to GER, agreeing to move A TRI to VEN while GER works from Tyrol. ITA continued threats with no sign of compromise.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We intend to move A TRI to VEN in coordination with GER’s advance against ITA. We will maintain our DMZ with RUS and hold firm in both Smyrna and Constantinople despite TUR’s threats. We seek to weaken ITA swiftly and defend our Balkan holdings if TUR escalates conflict.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Our success against Italy depends on concerted pressure. I plan to move A TRI to VEN and can assist any push you make from Tyrol or Munich. Once Venice falls, we can solidify our border and turn our combined might toward any lingering threats. Let me know if you can commit units to keep Italy pinned while I strike.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I reaffirm our DMZ in Galicia and pledge no moves toward Warsaw or Moscow. Turkey’s aggression in the Balkans threatens us both—if you can clamp down on them from the north, it will weaken their stance around the Black Sea. Let us maintain our peace and coordinate to ensure Turkey cannot expand further.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your unwavering push into our lands forces my hand. If you will cease hostilities and respect my borders in Bulgaria and Smyrna, I am open to a truce.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I confirm our DMZ in Galicia without reservation. I remain focused on holding off Turkey’s assaults in the Balkans. If you can apply pressure from the north, it would greatly aid our shared goal of containing their aggression.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Withdrawal from Constantinople is not on the table so long as you occupy Serbia and threaten Bulgaria and Smyrna. If you truly wish for peace, then pull out of Serbia and pledge not to invade my centers. Only then can we discuss a genuine ceasefire.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your friendship is invaluable. I will move A TRI to VEN and would appreciate any pressure you can bring from Tyrol or Munich to keep Italy pinned. Once Venice is ours, we can lock down the frontier and turn our joint forces on bigger threats.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I appreciate your reaffirmation of the DMZ. I agree that TUR's aggression is a threat to us both. I will focus on containing them in the Black Sea. I will move A WAR to SEV and A RUM to SEV. I expect you to hold the line in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I confirm our plan to advance A TRI to VEN while you move A MUN to TYR to pin down ITA. I intend to move A BUD to SER to secure the Balkans. Once Venice is taken, we can lock our border and coordinate our next moves against any further threats.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> During the winter adjustments, we built an army in BUD. ENG built a fleet in LVP, FRA built armies in MAR and BRE, while TUR disbanded a fleet in SEV and GER disbanded armies in BOH and SIL.
We reaffirmed our alliance with GER against ITA, agreeing to move TRI-VEN with GER’s support from MUN-TYR. We also upheld the DMZ with RUS, coordinating resistance against TUR, who is refusing to leave SER and threatens escalation. ITA demanded Trieste and Tunis, threatening total destruction otherwise. We rejected TUR’s offers to withdraw from CON or support moves on RUM and insisted on them leaving SER voluntarily, which they also refused.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I intend to move A TRI to VEN, A BUD to SER, and hold firm in CON against further TUR aggression. I will maintain the DMZ with RUS and continue collaborating with GER to contain ITA and align against TUR if necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move (S1906M), we secured SER from TUR and established an army in ANK (forcing TUR’s retreat to ARM). Our attempt at entering VEN from TRI was blocked by ITA’s counter, resulting in a stand-off. Meanwhile, GER advanced fleets and armies toward ITA, and RUS shifted units closer to TUR.
Throughout negotiations, ITA continued its hostile threats, demanding Trieste and Tunis. We reinforced our alliance with GER, coordinating a push through TYR toward VEN. RUS reassured us that its move into GAL was non-aggressive and proposed a joint strike on TUR. TUR repeatedly offered a swap of CON for withdrawing from SER, which we refused, insisting TUR evacuate SER or face a united assault.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will uphold our partnership with GER to smash ITA by moving A TRI into TYR alongside GER’s A MUN → TYR. In parallel, we will cooperate with RUS, striking TUR from ANK and CON if RUS advances from SEV into RUM or the Black Sea. We will not cede CON, and we plan to keep the DMZ with RUS around GAL so we can focus on eliminating ITA and containing TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1906M, we successfully repositioned units around the Balkans and shifted an army towards Venice while consolidating forces in Trieste. Germany, England, and France also advanced in Northern Europe. The Winter adjustments (W1906A) saw Austria strengthen with builds in Budapest and Vienna, while Russia disbanded a fleet and Germany built an army in Munich.
Throughout the S1907M talks, we coordinated closely with Germany to attack Italy by moving A TYR to VEN while GER moves A MUN to TYR. Russia confirmed their moves into RUM and toward SEV, expecting us to strike Turkey from ANK and in the Balkans. Turkey refused any demands to withdraw from the region, opting for open conflict. Italy repeatedly threatened Vienna, insisting they would crush us and Germany.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A TYR to VEN, supported by GER’s A MUN to TYR. We also plan to strike Turkey from ANK and maintain pressure in the Balkans in coordination with RUS. No concessions will be given to TUR or ITA. We maintain our alliance with GER and a cooperative stance toward RUS.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Our partnership has been invaluable. Let us finalize the squeeze on ITA by marching your army from MUN to TYR while I strike VEN. I’ll hold my eastern border in check with RUS so we can concentrate on leveraging your power in the north and our armies in the south to finish off ITA without distraction.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We remain committed to our DMZ agreement in GAL and appreciate your stance against TUR. If you push ahead from SEV into BLA, I will press TUR from ARM and CON, ensuring we split their forces. With our combined pressure, TUR cannot stand long.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your threats have only galvanized me and GER against you. However, I’ll make one final offer of peace: vacate VEN and recognize my hold on TRI, and we can discuss a truce that frees you to expand elsewhere.

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1907, we pushed successfully into VEN while also repositioning eastward: ARM was secured from ANK, BUD advanced to SER, and BUL moved to GRE. Our navy shifted from AEG to ION, reinforcing our southern flank. These moves sealed our hold on the southeast and established a solid front against ITA.
Through diplomatic exchanges, we reaffirmed our strong alliance with GER against ITA and coordinated with RUS to strike TUR. TUR repeatedly offered late proposals that we rejected, citing their earlier aggression. ITA openly refused our peace offers, preferring all-out conflict. Promises to RUS were maintained regarding the DMZ in GAL and cooperation against TUR. GER pledged support for our move on VEN.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will finalize a two-pronged approach: continue our offensive against ITA in coordination with GER, and press TUR in tandem with RUS. Specifically, we intend to move A ARM to SEV to assist RUS in eliminating TUR, while keeping pressure in the Balkans. We remain fixed on holding VEN and pushing ITA back, confident GER will support our attack from TYR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the fall of 1907, AUT solidified control of VEN and advanced into the Ionian, while ITA attempted a counter. GER pressed east and north, relocating forces near the Balkans. RUS maneuvered units closer to the Turkish front, and TUR pulled back to ANK. Afterward, each power built or disbanded units, positioning for this spring’s confrontations.
Throughout these talks, AUT coordinated heavily with GER to finish off ITA, promising to move VEN to ROM while GER brings pressure from MUN and TYR. With RUS, AUT confirmed a plan to strike TUR from ARM as RUS shifts SEV to RUM and UKR to WAR, maintaining the DMZ in GAL. ITA repeatedly delivered threats, insisting on recapturing VEN. TUR refused any peaceful withdrawal and threatened aggression instead. AUT remained firm in rejecting demands from both ITA and TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> AUT intends to move A VEN toward ROM and hold TYR, coordinating with GER’s movements against ITA. Against TUR, AUT will attack ANK from ARM, hoping RUS follows through with moves from SEV to RUM and UKR to WAR. AUT honors the DMZ in GAL with RUS and continues its alliance with GER to divide ITA’s centers.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your rejection of my offer is noted. However, I urge you to reconsider. A divided Balkans is preferable to a bloody war that will weaken both of us. I am willing to negotiate further, but I will not abandon my claims in the region. Perhaps we can discuss specific territories and guarantees to ensure stability for both our empires.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, Venice is mine. Your resistance is futile. Surrender now and perhaps I will spare your remaining territories. Continue to resist, and I will ensure your complete annihilation. The choice is yours.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1908M, our army advanced from VEN to TUS, gained control of VIE from BUD, and moved our fleet from AEG to ION. We also moved A ARM to ANK against Turkey. Meanwhile, France shifted units toward Italy, England consolidated around the North Sea, Germany repositioned from RUH to HOL, and Italy tried to defend by moving TUS to VEN and ION to ADR. Russia moved closer to Turkey via RUM and WAR.
We rejected Turkey’s offer to trade Serbia for Constantinople, instead aligning with Russia for a decisive strike on Turkey. France proposed collaboration against Italy, agreeing to mutual non-interference near Tyrol. Germany confirmed our joint plan to crush Italy, expecting us to move VEN to ROM and support them into Tyrol. Italy continued issuing threats of retribution should we resist.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to press forward into Italy by moving A VEN to ROM, coordinate with France to carve up Italian territory, and honor our pact with Germany, supporting their move into Tyrol. We will also finalize our assault on Turkey by moving from ARM to ANK, trusting Russia to maintain the DMZ in Galicia and assist from RUM, ensuring Turkey’s swift elimination.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Previously, our armies solidified positions in the Balkans and took Ankara, pushing A ANK to ARM while reinforcing our hold on Venice and moving VIE to BUD. We have steadily expanded at Italy’s expense, positioning a new army in Rome and maintaining pressure on Turkey.
In these talks, we coordinated closely with GER to crush ITA, agreeing to move from VEN to ROM while GER supports from TYR. We confirmed our DMZ with RUS in GAL and promised to keep up pressure on TUR from ARM. Meanwhile, FRA proposed a mutual attack on ITA, with FRA striking from TUN and WES. TUR repeatedly offered deals to halt hostilities, which we refused. ITA issued threats, insisting we relinquish VEN and TRI.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will finalize our assault on ITA by moving VEN to ROM and, alongside FRA, push deeper into Italy. At the same time, we sustain our alliance with RUS to drive TUR back, pressing from ARM. We reject Turkey’s overtures and maintain our commitment to break them in concert with Russia. Our plan is to secure Italy’s centers quickly with coordinated moves from GER and FRA.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Previously, we pushed aggressively into Turkey by ordering F AEG→CON and A ARM→ANK while simultaneously advancing A BUD→VIE, A GRE→BUL, and A ROM→NAP to maintain pressure on Italy. We also repositioned A TRI→VEN and shifted A BOH→TYR. These moves furthered our encirclement of Italy and strengthened our eastern front against Turkey.
In negotiations, we coordinated with GER and FRA to finalize Italy’s collapse. We reaffirmed our cooperation with RUS against TUR, maintaining our DMZ in GAL and pressing from ARM. ITA attempted to intimidate us into ceding VEN and TRI, but we rejected their threats. TUR offered a vague peace, yet refused to withdraw from the Balkans, solidifying our resolve to continue the offensive. We promised GER and FRA that we would maintain our pressure on Italy, while RUS expects us to keep pressing TUR in the Balkans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Our plan is to move VEN→ROM while holding TYR and continuing our eastern aggression against Turkey. We will keep FRA and GER at ease by fulfilling our promises to crush ITA, and we will uphold our peaceful border with RUS to coordinate a joint offensive on TUR. We intend to ignore TUR’s peace overtures unless they fully withdraw, focusing instead on a decisive strike to seize control of Italy and end the Turkish threat.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1909R, Turkey’s fleet retreated from CON to SMY. During W1909A, England disbanded F SPA/NC, and Russia built two armies (A MOS and A WAR). No other adjustments occurred.
This turn’s talks focused on dismantling Italy and Turkey. France and Germany both pledged to help Austria target Italy, with coordination around Venice and Rome. Russia committed to pressuring Turkey from SEV and RUM, aligning with Austria’s plan to attack from ARM and CON. Turkey insisted on regaining Constantinople or forming a truce, which Austria refused. Italy issued repeated threats but received no concessions. France hinted at expanding moves against Germany and England, while Germany cautioned Austria about France's intentions. Austria maintained the DMZ in Galicia with Russia and reaffirmed the alliance with Germany against Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Austria intends to move TYR to VEN with German support and push from VEN to ROM, securing Italy’s downfall while France takes the peninsula’s west. Against Turkey, Austria plans to attack from ARM and CON, coordinating with Russia’s moves from RUM and SEV. The alliance with Germany remains strong; Austria remains watchful of France’s broader maneuvers.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We successfully pushed the Turkish fleet out of Smyrna and solidified our grip on Italy by advancing into Trieste and Tyrolia. Turkey’s forced retreat to Syria and Italy’s attempted move into Trieste both failed to halt our momentum.
We reaffirmed our close cooperation with GER and FRA to partition Italy, agreeing to a coordinated pincer (TYR → VEN and VEN → ROM). RUS and we aligned on continued pressure against TUR, honoring the DMZ in Galicia. ITA demanded we cede Trieste and Venice, which we refused, and TUR insisted we evacuate Smyrna, which we also rejected. Promises among our allies remain firm: mutual non-aggression with FRA and GER, and joint aggression against ITA and TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A VEN → ROM, supported by GER’s move A TYR → VEN to collapse ITA’s position. Against TUR, we continue from ARM and CON in coordination with RUS to secure Ankara and finish Turkey’s defense. We maintain our DMZ with RUS in Galicia and stand by our agreements with GER and FRA for a swift end to ITA.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In W1910A, we built an army in BUD, while ENG disbanded two fleets (EDI and YOR), FRA built an army in PAR, and GER built an army in KIE. There were no retreat moves in F1910R.
The main focus was coordinating against ITA and TUR. FRA demanded immediate control of VEN, but we deferred, promising to cede it once ITA was finished. We reaffirmed a joint attack plan with GER: our A VEN to ROM, GER’s A TYR to VEN. Meanwhile, we assured RUS we would press TUR from SMY and CON. TUR remained defiant, threatening to reclaim SMY. We held firm on not yielding territory to TUR, and we delayed FRA’s request for VEN to maintain momentum against ITA.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We intend to move A VEN to ROM, supported by GER’s move from TYR to VEN. We will also press TUR from SMY and CON in concert with RUS’s advance from RUM and SEV. We will hold VEN temporarily despite FRA’s demands, resolving that transfer after ITA is decisively eliminated.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your plan to move A TYR to VEN and support my drive on ROM is perfect for crushing ITA once and for all. I remain willing to strike MUN from BOH if you can support from RUH. Let me know if that is feasible—if not, we will focus all efforts on Italy’s final downfall, confident in our rock-solid alliance.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous move, we seized Smyrna from TUR and drove forward on ITA’s positions, using support from CON and EAS to secure SMY while shifting armies toward Italy (VEN, TYR, PIE, TUR). FRA advanced into MUN and consolidated positions along the western front. TUR retreated from SMY to SYR.
We negotiated closely with GER to coordinate a joint strike on MUN and finalize Italy’s downfall. FRA demanded immediate cession of Venice and turned hostile when we delayed. We assured RUS we would continue pressing TUR from SMY, keeping GAL demilitarized. ITA and TUR each threatened us, demanding our retreat, but we rebuffed them and vowed to continue our offensives.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will follow through with GER’s support to attack MUN from BOH, while GER moves from RUH to KIE. We will also have GER’s TYR move to VEN in support of our push into Rome. Against TUR, we will hold SMY and push from CON to keep up the pressure. We will not cede Venice to FRA yet, despite their threats, focusing instead on eliminating ITA first. We plan to maintain close cooperation with RUS to finish off TUR.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Previously, France retreated from KIE to HOL, while Italy and Turkey each built armies in ROM and SMY. Our occupation of Smyrna remained uncontested, and the overall strategic picture did not drastically change. We continued to hold key positions in the Balkans and Italy, positioning ourselves for the upcoming campaign.
Recent talks centered on our coordinated efforts with GER and RUS to eliminate ITA and TUR swiftly. RUS agreed to strike Turkey from RUM and SEV while we hold SMY and CON. GER reiterated its support for our move from VEN to ROM. ITA and TUR both threatened retribution, but we refused to concede our advances. FRA has remained hostile but is occupied with other concerns in Western Europe.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will attack TUR from SMY and CON in concert with RUS’s moves from RUM and SEV. We will also push VEN to ROM, supported by PIE, counting on GER’s assistance through TYR. Our DMZ with RUS in GAL stands. We aim to overpower ITA and TUR before turning to broader opportunities.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the Spring 1912 moves, we pushed from Syria to Smyrna successfully, while preparing to attack Italy from Venice. Germany continued supporting our anti-Italian efforts. Russia moved to consolidate around Sevastopol and Norway, and France shifted units toward Tyrol and Munich, indicating growing aggression.
Throughout negotiations, we secured Germany’s support to take Rome from Venice with additional support from Piedmont, reaffirmed a joint strike on Turkey with Russia, and attempted to reassure France that we would not provoke conflict if they held off attacking Venice. Italy and Turkey both threatened us fiercely. Our main commitments were to push forward against Italy and Turkey while maintaining alliances with Germany and Russia. France insisted on demanding Venice and grew more hostile, but we refused to yield.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A VEN to ROM supported by A PIE and by Germany from TYR, intending to eliminate the Italian threat. Simultaneously, we plan to press Turkey from Smyrna and Constantinople to coordinate with Russia’s advance from Sevastopol and Rumania. We will not instigate direct conflict with France unless they move against our positions. Our armed focus remains on crushing Italy and Turkey quickly.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1912M, we maintained strong defensive positions and attempted VEN to ROM while holding ground in MUN, BUL, SER, GRE, and SMY. Our subsequent Winter build placed a new army in TRI, reinforcing our southern front.
Throughout the S1913M negotiations, we reaffirmed our alliance with GER against ITA and secured RUS collaboration to eliminate TUR. We pledged not to intrude on FRA if they likewise avoid our territory. ITA threatened repeatedly but was rebuffed. We assured RUS of our continued DMZ in GAL and agreed on a final coordinated push against TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will proceed with an attack from VEN to ROM, supported by PIE and GER’s A TYR, to break ITA. Meanwhile, we will move from SMY to ARM and hold CON, coordinating with RUS’s plan to move from SEV to BLA. Our alliance with GER remains strong, and we aim to deter any FRA incursion. No shift in stance toward ENG at this time.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Our bond remains strong. Let us finalize Italy’s collapse by pushing into Rome together. I pledge VEN → ROM with support from PIE.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Our cooperation is invaluable. I plan to maintain the DMZ in GAL and strike Turkey from SMY and CON. If you advance further from RUM or into BLA, we can finish TUR more quickly. I give you my word: no moves into your spheres, so let us squeeze TUR until they break.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1913, we advanced our fleet from EAS to ION while holding most of our armies in place. We attempted to move A VEN to ROM with Germany’s support plan in mind. France and Italy both converged on the Italian peninsula, but our position stayed strong, and no major territorial shifts occurred for us.
Throughout discussions, we solidified our alliance with GER against ITA, agreeing on mutual moves (VEN to ROM, TYR to VEN). We also reaffirmed a DMZ in GAL with RUS while working together to eliminate TUR. FRA insisted on non-interference around Tyrol, but showed some hostility toward us. ITA’s repeated threats went unheeded. Our vows to RUS and GER remain intact, while FRA’s and ITA’s demands were firmly rejected.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to push VEN to ROM with support from PIE, coordinating closely with GER’s A TYR to VEN. We will continue to press TUR from SMY and maintain the DMZ in GAL with RUS. We seek to finalize ITA’s collapse and remain vigilant toward FRA without provoking direct conflict unless necessary.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We appreciate your continued cooperation. Let’s maintain our DMZ in Galicia while I strike into Turkey from SMY and CON. Your pressure from SEV or RUM will help seal TUR’s fate. With Italy in retreat, our combined front against Turkey will be unstoppable.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last move, we advanced into Rome from Venice with support from Piedmont, furthering our hold in Italy. Our fleet also shifted from EAS to ION, securing the Ionian Sea. Other fronts remained largely static, with our units holding positions around Munich, Serbia, and Smyrna.
We coordinated closely with GER to push decisively into Italy and with RUS to encircle TUR. ITA continued to threaten us with demands for Trieste and Venice, which we rebuffed. GER and RUS promised support for our shared goals—GER against ITA and RUS against TUR—while FRA signaled a preference to stay out of an immediate conflict if we respect their holdings.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We intend to finalize our assault on Italy by ordering VEN to ROM (supported by PIE) and to continue our arrangement with GER to apply pressure from TYR. Simultaneously, we will move SMY to ARM and hold CON to pin TUR, trusting RUS to press from SEV and RUM. We maintain a DMZ with RUS in Galicia and aim to avoid entanglement with FRA.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> We will attack ITA by moving PIE to TUS with VEN’s support while also pressing on ROM. Simultaneously, we will push from SMY to ARM to aid RUS in crushing TUR. We keep TYR secure and uphold the DMZ with RUS in GAL.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, we fended off Italian aggression by holding our ground in MUN, TRI, BUL, GRE, SER, and SMY. We also made a slight adjustment by disbanding in ALB during the adjustment phase, while RUS built an army in MOS.
In negotiations, we reaffirmed our alliance with GER against ITA, coordinating moves from VEN and PIE into ROM and TUS. We also solidified plans with RUS to advance from SMY and CON against TUR while RUS moves on ANK. ITA continued to threaten us, insisting on taking Trieste, but we refused to concede any territory. FRA remains neutral only if we avoid clashing in Tyrol or Venice, though tensions linger.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to follow through on our promises to neighbors: pushing VEN to ROM and PIE to TUS with GER’s support, and pressing from SMY and CON against TUR in tandem with RUS. We remain vigilant about FRA’s potential aggression but will not provoke them unless necessary.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1915M, we solidified control of Naples and pushed Italy back by occupying Rome and reinforcing along our Balkan front. Russia advanced southward (taking SMY and positioning for a push on Turkey), and Germany moved to pressure Norway. Though France also maneuvered around Northern Italy, our primary gains included securing Naples and repositioning near CON for the attack on Turkey.
Throughout the recent talks, we coordinated closely with GER to eliminate ITA, agreeing on moves to seize ROM and TUS. We also aligned with RUS to dismantle TUR by supporting an attack on ANK. ITA demanded our withdrawal from Naples, threatening retaliation, but we stood firm. Our alliance with GER remains strong, and RUS has confirmed synchronized moves against TUR. FRA has shown no immediate hostility but remains watchful of our actions in Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move VEN to ROM and PIE to TUS with GER’s backing, maintaining pressure on ITA. Simultaneously, we will support RUS from CON into ANK while shifting SMY to ARM, ensuring TUR’s collapse. We will hold defensive positions in MUN and surrounding areas, honoring the DMZ in GAL with RUS. Our goal is to secure Italy’s final centers swiftly and crush Turkey in coordination with RUS.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We successfully pushed Italy out of Venice toward Rome and held key positions around Nap, Tyrol, and Piedmont. Russia advanced from Fin to Swe, Arm to Ank, and threatened Bul and Con, while Germany consolidated its northern fleet in Nth. France shifted forces between Bel, Bur, and Tus but has turned openly hostile over Venice.
France repeatedly demanded Venice and issued threats, accusing us of cowardice. Russia proposed coordinating to eliminate Turkey by moving A ARM to ANK and was grateful for our support from CON. Germany reaffirmed support in crushing Italy, encouraging us to press Italy in Rom and Tus and also hinting at pressuring Russia by moving Ser to Rum. We maintained that ceding Venice to France would destabilize our position, while confirming support for Russia’s attack on Turkey and continuing our joint offensive with Germany against Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A VEN to ROM, A PIE to TUS, and concurrently support Russia’s A ARM to ANK from CON to finish Turkey. We also plan to move A SER to RUM as Germany suggests, to keep pressure on Russia and maintain our alliance with GER. We remain prepared to defend Venice vigorously against France.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We pushed Trieste to Venice, Piedmont to Tuscany, Serbia to Rumania, and Constantinople to Bulgaria while sending our fleet from Naples to the Tyrrhenian Sea. This consolidated our hold in northern Italy and the Balkans.
Germany solidified its backing for our moves against Italy, agreeing to support us into Rome while we guard against Russian overreach. France demanded Venice and threatened action if we refused. Russia pressed for cooperation against Turkey, expecting our continued support into Ankara and a border DMZ in Galicia.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We intend to complete Italy’s downfall by moving Venice to Rome and using Tuscany to assist. We will rebuff France’s demands over Venice and stand ready to defend. Simultaneously, we uphold our pledge to Russia against Turkey, so long as they respect our mutual border.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> During the last adjustments, RUS retreated from SER to BUD and built an army in STP. AUT had no retreats or builds to perform, keeping steady on all fronts.
Negotiations centered on coordinating with GER to eliminate ITA, maintaining a defensive stance against FRA’s threats over Venice, and reassuring RUS of continued cooperation against TUR. GER pledged support into ROM and TUS, while AUT promised only a temporary occupation of RUM to balance RUS’s growing power. FRA remained hostile and demanded Venice. AUT insisted on retaining Venice until ITA is neutralized.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> AUT will move A VEN→ROM (supported by GER in TYR), A PIE→TUS, and occupy RUM to safeguard against possible RUS expansion. The plan is to finish off ITA in concert with GER and remain cooperative with RUS in eliminating TUR, while preparing to defend Venice if FRA attacks.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1917, we tried pushing France out of Munich while advancing from Piedmont to Marseilles and Tuscany to Venice. Although we briefly lost Munich and had to retreat to Bohemia, our other advances solidified positions in northern Italy and the Balkans. Russia repositioned from Budapest to Galicia, and our Ser-Rum march succeeded with support from Gal and Bul.
France has repeatedly demanded Venice, threatening to support Italy against us if we refuse. We have no intention of yielding Venice while Italy remains an enemy. Russia wants to coordinate against Turkey, moving from Budapest to Serbia and expecting us to hold Rum. Germany pledged continued cooperation, though they will not support our move into Munich this turn, prioritizing Prussia instead. England proposes a two-front assault on France, asking us to advance from Marseilles while they move fleets toward Brest and Belgium.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to maintain our alliance with Germany, accepting their shift of focus to Pru. We will hold Rum while letting Russia move into Ser in order to finally eliminate Turkey. We intend to strike at France’s southern holdings from Marseilles, coordinating with England’s northern push. We remain firm in keeping Venice, ready to counter any French or Italian aggression.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: My esteemed ally, I am moving A BOH to MUN. I expect you to move A VEN to ROM and A PIE to TUS. Let us crush ITA and then turn our attention to FRA. I will support your efforts against FRA from RUH and BEL. I am committed to our alliance. I will hold MUN and stand ready to join any push you make against FRA from RUH or BEL.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous phase, FRA’s army in MUN retreated to SIL and was then disbanded, while we built an army in TRI. No other major power shifts occurred.
Throughout these talks, FRA demanded Venice and threatened war. We refused and secured coordination with ENG to strike FRA from the south and west. GER reaffirmed our alliance, urging a coordinated push into any remnants of ITA and eventual moves against FRA. RUS agreed to maintain a DMZ in GAL and avoid conflict for now. Promises were made to ENG and GER to advance on FRA, while maintaining non-aggression with RUS.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to move A MAR to BUR with ENG moving from ENG to BEL, forcing FRA onto the defensive. We will support GER’s push into Italy, as promised, and honor our DMZ with RUS. We stand firm in holding Venice against FRA’s threats.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG, GER]: Friends, I will drive A MAR to BUR to pin FRA, while continuing to pin ITA’s remnants. ENG, your push on BEL is perfect to lock FRA down.

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We advanced successfully into key positions: VIE to BUD, TRI to SER, BUL to CON. ENG moved fleets toward BEL and NWY. FRA regrouped around BUR and POR. GER shifted units into FIN and SWY, while RUS attempted ANK and moved SER to RUM but was forced to retreat to GRE. Our position around RUM and BUD was bolstered, further constraining TUR and FRA.
FRA threatened vengeance after our move on Italy. ENG and GER reaffirmed cooperation against FRA, while GER hinted at eventually pressuring ENG as well. RUS agreed to respect our hold on RUM but demanded we continue helping against TUR. We insisted on denying RUS entry into RUM to avoid conflict, reassuring them of our intention to stay allied. Our main coordination centered on dividing FRA’s defenses and finishing TUR, with all parties wary of each other’s next moves.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A MAR to BUR to disrupt FRA, maintain RUM to keep RUS at bay, and push on remaining TUR holdings. We aim to complete FRA’s collapse with ENG and GER, keep ITA pinned, and remain watchful of any RUS overreach. Our strategy is to preserve alliances with ENG and GER while balancing RUS’s demands in the Balkans.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> FRA retreated its army from BUR to PIC. In the winter adjustments, we built A VIE and F TRI, while RUS disbanded A FIN and A NWY. No other major changes were made.
We coordinated with ENG and GER to intensify pressure on FRA from multiple fronts. We reaffirmed a DMZ with RUS in GAL, allowing them to eliminate TUR without interference.

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I am concerned about your insistence on moving A MAR to SPA. FRA has units there. I strongly advise A MAR to BUR supported by A RUH. This will cut off FRA's retreat and weaken their position. I will support you in BEL. Please reconsider your move. This is my final offer.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1919M, we repositioned our forces strongly: moving MUN to RUH (supported by BUR), MAR to SPA, and reshuffling troops in the Balkans and Central Europe (VIE, BUD, SER, GRE, ALB) to tighten control. ENG advanced fleets to BEL and NWY. FRA shifted units around PAR, BUR, BEL, and SPA. GER consolidated in NWY, KIE, BEL. RUS retreated from UKR to GAL.
We coordinated with GER to attack FRA, planning to take MUN and SPA simultaneously. ENG advised an alternative move from MAR to BUR, but we stood firm on MAR to SPA with WES support. RUS reaffirmed DMZ in GAL and will move on TUR. FRA threatened us over Venice but we refused. Overall, we aligned with GER and maintain cautious cooperation with ENG while ignoring FRA’s demands.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A RUH to BUR, A BOH to MUN (supported by A BUR), and A MAR to SPA (supported by F WES). We will also respect RUS’s Turkish offensive and keep GAL demilitarized. Our goal is to weaken FRA swiftly, then pivot to finalize operations against ITA.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Greetings, friend. Our combined pressure on FRA is yielding results, and I propose we intensify it.

We can split FRA’s remaining centers fairly—and quickly—if we maintain our coordinated assault.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: England, let us continue our cooperation against FRA. I stand ready to strike from the south if you can apply pressure on their northern coastline.

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, congratulations on your gains. I intend to maintain our DMZ in GAL and avoid any conflict on our shared border.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In W1919A, we built an army in TRI while FRA destroyed its army in GAS and RUS built in STP. Overall, there were no major territorial changes, though RUS retreated its army from GAL to WAR in the preceding retreat phase.
We refused FRA’s demands to yield VEN, solidified plans with ENG and GER to strike FRA from multiple angles, and confirmed our DMZ with RUS while they advance on TUR. FRA repeatedly threatened us over VEN, but ENG and GER reiterated their support in dismantling FRA. RUS pledged to respect our shared border and focus on eliminating TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will attack FRA by moving RUH to BUR and MAR to GAS, aiming to seize SPA and further weaken FRA while coordinating with ENG and GER. We will uphold our DMZ with RUS and let them finish TUR unhindered. We maintain our refusal to surrender VEN to FRA, and we seek to retain ENG and GER as close allies in the coming phase.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the prior moves, we advanced from WES into MAO and repositioned forces in central Europe (RUH to HOL, among others), while RUS moved against TUR. GER had to retreat a fleet from NTH to HEL. Our occupation of parts of FRA’s perimeter began to tighten, and ENG’s fleets pushed closer to FRA’s coastal holdings.
All talks revolved around a joint effort with GER and ENG to crush FRA in the west. We reaffirmed a DMZ with RUS and supported their final eradication of TUR. FRA threatened us over Venice, demanding its return and vowing retribution, but we maintained a firm alliance with GER and warm relations with ENG to continue the offensive. RUS sought our non-interference in their anti-TUR campaigns, which we granted.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We intend to move RUH to BUR and MAR toward GAS to destabilize FRA’s lines. We will coordinate with GER, whose MUN moves are directed against FRA, and ENG’s fleets pressing from the Channel and BEL. We will respect the Russia–Austria DMZ and allow RUS free rein to eliminate TUR. We remain unswayed by FRA’s threats, maintaining a united front with GER and ENG.</li>

We ignored FRA’s threats and stood by RUS's plan to finish TUR unopposed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move RUH→BUR backed by GER’s MUN→RUH, shift VIE→BOH to pressure FRA further, and respect RUS’s campaign against TUR. Our goal is to press FRA from multiple directions while honoring the DMZ with RUS.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1921M, we pushed our forces westward, moving A SPA to POR and supporting A BEL into HOL. We advanced from MAR to GAS and PIE to TUS, with our fleets shifting from NAF to MAO and LYO to WES. Our armies in BUD, UKR, SEV, SER, BUL, and WAR held as we consolidated our positions.
We coordinated closely with ENG and GER to intensify the assault on FRA, agreeing on moves like RUH→BUR and GAS→PAR. RUS confirmed it would finish off TUR and maintain a DMZ in GAL, which we did not contest. FRA continued to threaten and insult, refusing any compromise.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Our primary goal is to break FRA by pushing from RUH into BUR and moving A GAS to PAR in tandem with allied support from ENG and GER. We will respect RUS’s operations against TUR and keep our DMZ in GAL. We intend to hold and secure newly acquired positions while continuing the joint offensive westward.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the last adjustments, we gained a new fleet in Trieste while England built a fleet in Liverpool and France built one in Brest. Russia disbanded its unit in Norway. No major strategic shifts occurred aside from positioning fleets and armies for the coming spring campaign.
We coordinated with England and Germany to mount a joint attack on France, exchanging detailed moves on how to break French defenses around Burgundy and Paris. We reaffirmed a demilitarized border with Russia in Galicia, supporting its offensive against Turkey. France issued threats and demands but offered no real concessions, increasing its isolation.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We plan to move A RUH into BUR, supported by our allies’ units. We also intend to push toward PAR from GAS or MAR to tighten pressure on France. We will honor the DMZ with Russia and focus on defeating France, relying on our alliance with Germany and a friendly alignment with England. We have no intention to challenge Russia in the Balkans this turn.</li>

Throughout negotiations, ENG and GER pledged support for our coordinated assault on FRA, aiming to overwhelm them in BUR and PAR. RUS confirmed their focus on finishing TUR and asked us to keep GAL demilitarized and leave RUM alone. FRA remained defiant, offering no concessions and issuing empty threats. We all reaffirmed our plans to press the attack on FRA while leaving RUS to handle TUR unopposed.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> We will move A RUH to BUR (supported by GER), A GAS to PAR, and use our fleets (TYS, WES) to pin down FRA’s naval forces. We will comply with RUS’s request by maintaining the DMZ in GAL and not interfering with their takeover of TUR’s centers. Our immediate goal is to eliminate FRA’s outposts and maintain our alliance with ENG and GER.</li>
